PRAY YOU CATCH ME

YOU CAN TASTE THE DISHONESTY, IT’S ALL OVER YOUR BREATH
AS YOU PASS IT OFF SO CAVALIER, BUT EVEN THAT’S A TEST
CONSTANTLY AWARE OF IT ALL, MY LONELY EAR
PRESSED AGAINST THE WALLS OF YOUR WORLD

PRAY TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME LISTENING
I’M PRAYING TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME

I’M PRAYING TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME LISTENING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME

NOTHING ELSE EVER SEEMS TO HURT LIKE THE SMILE ON YOUR FACE
WHEN IT’S ONLY IN MY MEMORY, IT DON'T HIT ME QUITE THE SAME
MAYBE IT’S A CAUSE FOR CONCERN, BUT I'M NOT AT EASE
KEEPING MY HEAD TO THE CURB

PRAY TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME LISTENING
I PRAY TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME
I’M PRAYING YOU CATCH ME



HOLD UP

HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
BACK UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
STEP DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU

WHAT A WICKED WAY TO TREAT THE GIRL THAT LOVES YOU
HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU

SOMETHING DON’T FEEL RIGHT
BECAUSE IT AIN’T RIGHT
ESPECIALLY COMING UP AFTER MIDNIGHT

HOW DID IT COME DOWN TO THIS
SCROLLING THRU YOUR CALL LIST
I DON’T WANT TO LOSE MY PRIDE BUT I’MA F---- ME UP A BITCH
KNOW THAT I KEPT IT SEXY
YOU KNOW I KEPT IT FUN
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I’M MISSING? MAYBE MY HEAD FOR ONE

HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU

LET’S IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT 
THAT YOU NEVER MADE A NAME 
FOR YOURSELF MASTER WEALTH THEY HAD YOU LABELED AS A KING
NEVER MADE IT OUT THE CASE
STILL OUT THERE MOVING IN THEM STREETS
NEVER HAD THE BADDEST WOMEN IN THE GAME UP IN YOUR SHEETS
WOULD THEY BE DOWN TO RIDE, NO
THEY USED TO HIDE FROM LIE TO YA
BUT Y’ALL KNOW WE WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER 
SO I FIND YOU AND HOLD YOU DOWN

HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
BACK UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
STEP DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
CAN’T YOU SEE THERE’S NO OTHER MAN ABOVE YOU
WHAT A WICKED WAY TO TREAT THE GIRL THAT LOVES YOU
HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU

BABE IT'S SUCH A SHAME
YOU LET THIS GOOD LOVE GO TO WASTE

BACK SEAT LOVIN IN THE CAR

WHAT'S WORSE LOOKING JEALOUS AND CRAZY, JEALOUS AND CRAZY
OR LIKE BEING WALKED ALL OVER LATELY, WALKED ALL OVER LATELY
I’D RATHER BE CRAZY

HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
BACK UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
STEP DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU

LEMONADE
CRAZY IN LOVE

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me lookin’ so crazy right now, your love’s
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now your love
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now, your touch
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now your touc)
Got me hopin’ you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hopin’ you'll save me right now
Lookin’ so crazy in love's
Got me lookin’, got me lookin’
Lookin’ so 
Lookin’ so 
Lookin’ so

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no


When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat in my heart skips when I'm with you
I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Chorus: Beyoncé
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now 
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now
Crazy right now 
Crazy right now
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now 
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now
Crazy right now

SO MUCH D**** SWAG 

I grew up in Houston, Texas and visiting Prairie View
We rehearsed at TSU for many years in Third Ward
And I always dreamed of going to an HBCU
My college was Destiny’s Child 
My college was traveling around the world and life was my teacher
I wanted a black orchestra, I wanted the steppers, I needed the vocalists
I wanted different characters, I didn’t want us all doing the same thing 
The amount of swag is just limitless, like the things that these young people can do with their bodies and the music they can play and the drumrolls, and the haircuts and the bodies.
It’s just not right, it’s just so much d--- swag



SORRY

I ain’t sorry

I ain’t picking up I ain’t sorry
I’m headed to the club I ain’t sorry
I ain’t thinking ‘bout you I ain’t sorry

Me and my ladies sip my D'ussé cups
I don’t give a f---- chucking my deuces up
Suck on my b--- pause

Suck on my b----
Suck on my b----pause

Suck on my b----
Suck on my b----
Suck on my b----
Suck on my b----pause

Hell na
Hell na
Middle Fingers up
Middle Fingers up
Put em hands high
Put em hands high
Wave it in his face
Wave it in his face
Tell him boy bye
Tell him, tell him boy bye
Tell him boy bye
Tell him, tell him boy bye
Tell him boy bye
Tell him, tell him boy bye
Tell him boy bye
Tell him, tell him boy bye
I ain’t think about you.

Middle fingers up 
Put them hands high
Wave it in his face 
Tell ‘em boy bye

Middle fingers up 
Iain’t thinking 'bout you

I ain’t sorry
Iain’t sorry
Iain’t sorry
I ain’t thinking 'bout you
I ain’t sorry
I ain’t sorry
I ain’t sorry
No No , hell nah

Now you want to say you're sorry
Now you want to call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got
Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry


Sing it 
Sing it
Sing it Ladies

From now on I’ma be my own bestfriend
Right Ladies?


I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't f------with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
You better call Becky with the good hair



KITTY KAT

Rock diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my records
Since fifteen coming down reppin’ Texas
How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain'tgots to lie Craig
What about my body, body?
You don’t want my body, body?
Acting like I'm nobody
You gon' make me call somebody

Let’s go little Kitty Kat
I think it’s time to go
Let’s go little Kitty Kat
He don’t want no more
Let’s go little Kitty Kat

He better call Becky with the good hair



BOW DOWN

Call Becky with the good hair

Beyoncé: Coachella!
Thank y’all so much for having us once again.
I’m so honored to be on this stage tonight.
This next song is for all of my queens.
Do we have any beautiful queens in the house tonight?
I want y’all to sing along if y’all know the lyrics.
It’s called Bow Down.

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don’t forget it, don’t forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches

But don’t think I’m just his little wife
Don’t get it twisted, get it twisted

Rolling high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what good
Kiss my momma, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talking lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick, smack that trick
Guess what they did, smack that trick
Gold everything, gold a-- chains
Gold a-- rings, gold a-- fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the capital B, I don't need no hype
The capital B means, I'm 'bout that life
The capital B means, I'm 'bout that life b----



DRUNK IN LOVE

I'm on the Armand de Brignac, yeah gangsta wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singin’ on the mic to my boy’s toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway 
Then ride with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard

Big body been swervin’ all this

As a black woman
I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box
And black women often feel underestimated 
I wanted us to feel proud of not only the show but the process
Proud of the struggle
Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain
Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right
And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves , their sas, their honesty
Thankful for their freedom



DON’T HURT YOURSELF

You ain’t married to no average b---- boy

If you try this shit again 
You gonna lose your wife



I CARE

I told you how you hurt me baby, 
But you don’t care 
Now I’m crying and deserted baby, but you don’t care 
Ain’t nobody tell me this is love, when you’re immune to all my pain  
I need you to tell me this is love, you don’t care well that’s ok  

Well I care 
I know you don’t care too much  
But I still care, la, la, la… baby, la, la, la…  
Oh I care  
I know you don’t care too much 
But I still care, la, la, baby, la, la, la… ohhh  

Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry  
And now every time our love goes sour, you won’t sympathize 
You see these tears falling down to my ears, i swear you like when i’m in pain 
I try to tell you all my fears, you still don’t care, well that’s ok  
Listen

Well I care  
I know you don’t care too much 
But I still care, la, la, la… baby, la, la, la…  
Oh I care  
I know you don’t care too much 
But I still care, la, la, baby, la, la, la… ohhh

You used to be so in love, 
Now you don’t care no more

DEJA VU 
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi hat, and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Baby where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you; helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl, you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro'
'Cause you gon' need help tryin' to study my bounce
Flow, blow--what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough--po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go; my flow keep the dough tipping
Like four-fours, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argument
I don't make the list; don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No déjà vu, just me and my, oh

Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having déjà vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane; I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having déjà vu?
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go

Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

Go gogogoooo
Go gogogoooo
Go gogogoooo
Go go RED LIGHT (ah) GREEN LIGHT!

Chimamanda
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much”
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful otherwise you will threaten the man
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments but for the attention of men
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes

LIFT EV’RY VOICE AND SING 

Let our rejoicing rise
high as the listening skies
let us march on till victory is won.

Yay! Beautiful job, Baba. You sound so pretty.

I want to do that again.

Oh you want to do it again, you're like mommy, huh?

Yes. I want to do that again. It feels good!

It feels good? 
(Laughs) 
Ok you want to
Go
Lift your voice and sing.

I feel we made something that made my daughter proud, made my mother proud, my father proud and all of the people that are my brothers and sisters around the world. That’s why I live. I’m so lucky and grateful that I’m able to take all these crazy ideas and actually make them into something that heals peoples that may spark vision in people. That shows them to dream big, that shows them that they are limitless. If my country ass can do it, they can do it



LOVE ON TOP

I wanna sing this last song to all my incredible, beautiful fans.
Loyal fans. 
Ride or dies. 
It’s dedicated to my incrediblebeyhive.

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane
And I can feel the stars whenever you're near, you’re near
Every time you touch me I just melt away

Everybody ask me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know (it's gonna take the real work)
Nothing's perfect but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears and you finally could put me first
Sing it y’all.

Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top

Baby cus you’re the one that I love,
Baby you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on baby it's you

WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
PERFECTION IS A DISEASE OF A NATION
PRETTY HURTS, PRETTY HURTS
PRETTY HURTS
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
WE TRY TO FIX SOMETHING 
BUT YA CAN'T FIX WHATCHA CAN'T SEE
IT’S THE SOUL THAT NEEDS SURGERY

BLONDER HAIR 
FLAT CHEST
TV SAYS
BIGGER IS BETTER
SOUTH BEACH
SUGAR FREE
VOGUE SAYS
THINNER IS BETTER

JUST ANOTHER STAGE
PAGEANT THE PAIN AWAY
THIS TIME I'M GONNA TAKE THE CROWN 
WITHOUT FALLING DOWN DOWN DOWN

PRETTY HURTS 
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
PERFECTION IS A DISEASE OF A NATION
PRETTY HURTS, PRETTY HURTS
PRETTY HURTS 
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
WE TRY TO FIX SOMETHING 
BUT YA CAN'T FIX WHATCHA CAN'T SEE
IT’S THE SOUL THAT NEEDS A SURGERY

BRIDGE
AIN'T GOT NO DOCTOR OR PILL THAT CAN TAKE THE PAIN AWAY
THE PAINS INSIDE AND NOBODY FREES YOU FROM YOUR BODY
IT'S MY SOUL IT'S MY SOUL THAT NEEDS SURGERY
IT’S MY SOUL THAT NEEDS SURGERY
PLASTIC SMILES AND DENIAL CAN ONLY TAKE YOU SO FAR
THEN YOU BREAK WHEN THE FAKE FACADE LEAVES YOU IN THE DARK
LEFT WITH SHATTERED MIRRORS AND THE SHARDS 
OF A BEAUTIFUL PAST
PRETTY HURTS 
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
PERFECTION IS A DISEASE OF A NATION
PRETTY HURTS, PRETTY HURTS
PRETTY HURTS 
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
WE TRY TO FIX SOMETHING 
BUT YA CAN'T FIX WHATCHA CAN'T SEE
IT’S THE SOUL THAT NEEDS SURGERY

PRETTY HURTS, PRETTY HURTS…….

WHEN YOU ARE ALONE ALL BY YOURSELF
WHEN YOU’RE LYING IN YOUR BED
REFLECTION STARES RIGHT INTO YOU
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOURSELF?
STRIPPED AWAY THE MASQUERADE
THE ILLUSION HAS BEEN SHED
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOURSELF?
YES



HAUNTED

AND I'VE BEEN DRIFTING OFF OF KNOWLEDGE
CAT-CALLS ON CAT-WALKS, MAN THESE WOMEN GETTING SOLEMN
I COULD SING A PSALM FOR A SOLOMON OR SALAMANDER
WE TOOK A FLIGHT AT MIDNIGHT AND NOW MY MIND CAN'T HELP BUT WANDER
HOW COME?
SPOON-FED PLURALIZED EYES TO FIND THE BEACHES IN THE FOREST
WHEN I'M LOOKING OFF THE EDGE, I PREACH MY GUT IT CAN'T HELP IGNORE IT
I'M CLIMBING UP THE WALLS CUZ ALL THE SH-- I HEAR IS BORING
ALL THE SH-- I DO IS BORING
ALL THESE RECORD LABELS BORING
I DON’T TRUST THESE RECORD LABELS, I’M TOURING 
ALL THESE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET WORKING 9 TO 5 JUST TO STAY ALIVE
THE 9 TO 5 JUST TO STAY ALIVE…. 
ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET WORKING 9 TO 5 JUST TO STAY ALIVE
HOW COME?

IT'S WHERE WE GO
IT'S WHERE WE'LL BE
I KNOW IF I'M ON TO YOU, I'M ON TO YOU
ON TO YOU, YOU MUST BE ON TO ME

MY HAUNTED LUNGS
GHOST IN THE SHEETS
I KNOW IF I'M HAUNTING YOU, YOU MUST BE HAUNTING ME
MY WICKED TONGUE, WHERE WILL IT BE?
I KNOW IF I'M ON TO YOU, I'M ON TO YOU
ON TO YOU, I'M ON TO YOU
ON TO YOU, YOU MUST BE ON TO ME

YOU WANT ME?
I WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY
YOU LUCKY?
THE BEDROOM'S THE WRONG WAY
SLAP ME, I'M PINNED TO THE DOORWAY
KISS, BITE, FOREPLAY

MY HAUNTED LUNGS
GHOST IN THE SHEETS
I KNOW IF I'M HAUNTING YOU, YOU MUST BE HAUNTING ME
MY WICKED TONGUE, WHERE WILL IT BE?
I KNOW IF I'M ON TO YOU, YOU MUST BE ON TO ME

IT'S WHAT WE SEE
I KNOW IF I'M HAUNTING YOU, YOU MUST BE HAUNTING ME
IT'S WHERE WE GO
IT'S WHERE WE'LL BE
I KNOW IF I'M ON TO YOU, I'M ON TO YOU

OTHERWISE YOU WILL THREATEN THE MAN
BECAUSE I AM FEMALE I AM EXPECTED TO ASPIRE TO MARRIAGE
I’M EXPECTED TO MAKE MY LIFE CHOICES ALWAYS KEEPING IN MIND
THAT MARRIAGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
MARRIAGE CAN BE A SOURCE OF JOY AND LOVE AND MUTUAL SUPPORT
BUT WHY DO WE TEACH GIRLS TO ASPIRE TO MARRIAGE AND WE DON’T TEACH BOYS THE SAME
WE RAISE GIRLS TO SEE EACH OTHER AS COMPETITORS, NOT FOR JOBS OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
WHICH I THINK CAN BE A GOOD THING
BUT FOR THE ATTENTION OF MEN
WE TEACH GIRLS THAT THEY CANNOT BE SEXUAL BEINGS IN THE WAY THAT BOYS ARE
FEMINIST: A PERSON WHO BELIEVES IN THE SOCIAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EQUALITY OF THE SEXES

SUPER POWER (FEAT. FRANK OCEAN)

WHEN THE PALM OF MY TWO HANDS
HOLD EACH OTHER
THAT FEELS DIFFERENT FROM WHEN YOUR HANDS
ARE IN MINE
THAT’S JUST THE WAY IT IS

AND WHEN MY VOICE IS SCREAMING OUT
TO MY OWN EARS 
THAT FEELS DIFFERENT
FROM WHEN I HEAR YOURS
NOW THAT’S JUST THE WAY IT IS

AND WHEN I’M STANDING IN THIS MIRROR
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
WHAT I’M VIEWING’S A LITTLE DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT YOUR EYES SHOW YA
I GUESS I DONE SEEN MYSELF BEFORE YA
MOVING FORWARD (SUPERPOWER)

A SUBTLE POWER (SUPERPOWER)
A TOUGH LOVE (SUPERPOWER)
OH, LIKE A SHARK (SUPERPOWER)
OOO, LIKE A BEAR 
A TOUGH LOVE

(AND I THOUGHT THE WORLD WOULD REVOLVE)
I THOUGHT THE WORLD WOULD REVOLVE
(WITHOUT US) 
WITHOUT US, WITHOUT US, WITHOUT US 
(BUT NOTHIN I KNOW)
COULD SLOW US DOWN
COULDN’T SLOW US DOWN
AND I THOUGHT I COULD LIVE WITHOUT YA, HEY, HEY
BUT NOTHIN I KNOW CAN BREAK US DOWN
THEY CAN’T BREAK US DOWN

AND JUST LIKE YOU I CAN’T BE SCARED
AND JUST LIKE YOU I HOPE I’M SPARED
BUT IT’S TOUGH LOVE
I KNOW YOU FEEL IT IN THE AIR
EVEN THE BABIES KNOW IT’S THERE
A TOUGH LOVE (SUPERPOWER)

THE LAWS OF THE WORLD TELL US WHAT GOES SKY AND WHAT FALLS
IT’S A SUPERPOWER (SUPERPOWER)
THE LAWS OF THE WORLD NEVER STOPPED US ONCE 
CAUSE TOGETHER WE GOT PLENTY SUPERPOWER (SUPERPOWER)

A SUBTLE POWER (SUPERPOWER)
A TOUGH LOVE (SUPERPOWER)
OH, LIKE A SHARK (SUPERPOWER)
OOO, TOO MUCH TO BARE (SUPERPOWER)

(AND I THOUGHT THE WORLD WOULD REVOLVE)
I THOUGHT THE WORLD WOULD REVOLVE
(WITHOUT US) 
WITHOUT US, WITHOUT US, WITHOUT US 
(BUT NOTHIN I KNOW)
COULD SLOW US DOWN
COULDN’T SLOW US DOWN
AND I THOUGHT I COULD LIVE WITHOUT YA, HEY, HEY
BUT TOGETHER WE GOT PLENTY POWER
BUT, NOTHIN I KNOW COULDN’T BREAK US DOWN
THEY CAN’T BREAK US DOWN (SUPERPOWER)

YES WE CAN
COULDN’T BREAK US DOWN
THEY CAN’T BREAK US DOWN
REPEAT



HEAVEN

OHHH…
I FOUGHT FOR YOU THE HARDEST
YOU MADE ME THE STRONGEST
SO TELL ME, YOUR SECRETS 
I JUST CAN’T STAND TO SEE YOU LEAVING

BUT HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
NO HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
NO HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
SO GO ON, GO HOME

WE LAUGHED AT THE DARKNESS
SO SCARED THAT WE LOST IT
WE STOOD ON THE CEILINGS
YOU SHOWED ME LOVE WAS ALL YOU NEEDED

HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
OH, HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
NO HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU… 
NO HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
NO! HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
NO! HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
OHH, HEAVEN COULDN’T WAIT FOR YOU
SO GO ON, GO HOME
SO GO ON, GO HOME

SOMETIMES THESE WALLS SEEM TO CAVE IN ON ME

IF I WERE A BOY

IF I WERE A BOY
EVEN JUST FOR A DAY
I’D ROLL OUTTA BED IN THE MORNING
AND THROW ON WHAT I WANTED THEN GO
DRINK BEER WITH THE GUYS
AND CHASE AFTER GIRLS
I’D KICK IT WITH WHO I WANTED
AND I’D NEVER GET CONFRONTED FOR IT
‘CAUSE THEY’D STICK UP FOR ME

IF I WERE A BOY
I THINK I COULD UNDERSTAND
HOW IT FEELS TO LOVE A GIRL
I SWEAR I’D BE A BETTER MAN 
I’D LISTEN TO HER
‘CAUSE I KNOW HOW IT HURTS
WHEN YOU LOSE THE ONE YOU WANTED
‘CAUSE HE’S TAKEN YOU FOR GRANTED
AND EVERYTHING YOU HAD GOT DESTROYED

IF I WERE A BOY
I WOULD TURN OFF MY PHONE
TELL EVERYONE IT’S BROKEN
SO THEY’D THINK THAT I WAS SLEEPIN’ ALONE
I’D PUT MYSELF FIRST AND MAKE THE RULES AS I GO 
‘CAUSE I KNOW THAT SHE’D BE FAITHFUL
WAITIN’ FOR ME TO COME HOME (TO COME HOME)

IF I WERE A BOY
I THINK I COULD UNDERSTAND
HOW IT FEELS TO LOVE A GIRL
I SWEAR I’D BE A BETTER MAN 
I’D LISTEN TO HER
‘CAUSE I KNOW HOW IT HURTS
WHEN YOU LOSE THE ONE YOU WANTED (WANTED)
‘CAUSE HE’S TAKEN YOU FOR GRANTED (GRANTED)
AND EVERYTHING YOU HAD GOT DESTROYED

IT’S A LITTLE TOO LATE FOR YOU TO COME BACK
SAY IT’S JUST A MISTAKE 
THINK I’D FORGIVE YOU LIKE THAT
IF YOU THOUGHT I WOULD WAIT FOR YOU
YOU THOUGHT WRONG

BUT YOU’RE JUST A BOY
YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND
YEAH YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND (OHH)
HOW IT FEELS TO LOVE A GIRL SOMEDAY
YOU’LL WISH YOU WERE A BETTER MAN
YOU DON’T LISTEN TO HER
YOU DON’T CARE HOW IT HURTS
UNTIL YOU LOSE THE ONE YOU WANTED
‘CAUSE YOU’VE TAKEN HER FOR GRANTED
AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE GOT DESTROYED
BUT YOU’RE JUST A BOY

BUT THIS DON’T EVEN FEEL LIKE FALLING
GRAVITY CAN’T BEGIN
TO PULL ME BACK TO THE GROUND AGAIN

IT’S LIKE I’VE BEEN AWAKENED
EVERY RULE I HAD YOU BREAKIN’ 
IT’S THE RISK THAT I’M TAKIN’
I AIN’T EVER GONNA SHUT YOU OUT

DISAPPEAR

IF I BEGGED AND IF I CRIED 
WOULD IT CHANGE THE SKY TONIGHT
WOULD IT GIVE ME SOME LIGHT
SHOULD I WAIT FOR YOU TO CALL 
IS THERE ANY HOPE AT ALL
ARE YOU DRIFTING BY

WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT
I KNOW THAT I WAS NEVER THERE 
OR EVEN CARED
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT
THE LESS THAT I WAS ABLE TO SHARE 
WITH YOU
I TRY TO REACH YOU I 
CAN ALMOST FEEL YOU
YOU’RE NEARLY HERE AND THEN
YOU DISAPPEAR, YOU DISAPPEAR

AND WHEN I LIE ALL BY MYSELF 
I SEE YOUR FACE AND I HEAR YOUR VOICE 
MY HEART STAYS FAITHFUL
AND TIME HAS COME AND TIME HAS PASSED 
IF IT’S GOOD IT’S GOT TO LAST 
IT FELT SO RIGHT

WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT
I KNOW THAT I WAS NEVER THERE 
OR EVEN CARED
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT
THE LESS THAT I WAS ABLE TO SHARE 
WITH YOU
I TRY TO REACH YOU I 
CAN ALMOST FEEL YOU
YOU’RE NEARLY HERE AND THEN
YOU DISAPPEAR, YOU DISAPPEAR

I MISSED ALL THE SIGNS 
ONE AT A TIME
YOU WERE READY 
WHAT DID I KNOW
STARTING OUR LIVES
NOW MY LOVE I’M READY TO SHOW

WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT
I KNOW THAT I WAS NEVER THERE 
OR EVEN CARED
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT
THE LESS THAT I WAS ABLE TO SHARE 
WITH YOU
I TRY TO REACH YOU I 
CAN ALMOST FEEL YOU
YOU’RE NEARLY HERE AND THEN
YOU DISAPPEAR, YOU DISAPPEAR

YOU DISAPPEAR
YOU DISAPPEAR
DISAPPEAR

AVE MARIA

SHE WAS LOST 
IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
OUT IN THE DARKNESS WITH NO GUIDE
I KNOW THE COST OF A LOSING HAND
NEVER FOR THE GRACE OF GOD

OH I, I FOUND HEAVEN ON EARTH 
YOU ARE MY LAST MY FIRST 
AND THEN I HEAR THIS VOICE INSIDE
AVE MARIA

I’VE BEEN ALONE
WHEN I’M SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS
HOW COULD THE SILENCE BE SO LOUD
BUT I STILL GO ON, KNOWING THAT I’VE GOT YOU
THERE’S ONLY US WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DOWN

YOU ARE MY HEAVEN ON EARTH 
YOU ARE MY HUNGER MY THIRST
I ALWAYS HEAR THIS VOICE INSIDE 
SAYING AVE MARIA

SOMETIMES LOVE CAN COME AND PASS YOU BY
WHILE YOU’RE BUSY MAKING PLANS
SUDDENLY HITS YOU AND THEN YOU REALIZE
IT’S OUT OF YOUR HANDS
BABY YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND

YOU ARE MY HEAVEN ON EARTH 
YOU ARE MY LAST MY FIRST 
AND THEN I HEAR THIS VOICE INSIDE 
AVE MARIA, AVE MARIA, AVE MARIA



SMASH INTO YOU

WAS RIGHT IN MY PATH, IN MY GRASP

THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL

DIAMONDS USED TO BE COAL
LOOK YOUNG ‘CAUSE THEY GOT SOUL
THAT’S WHY THEY’RE BEAUTIFUL 
AND MY HEART USED TO BE COLD
‘TIL YOUR HANDS LAID ON MY SOUL, BABY
AND THAT’S WHY YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL

I’M NOT WONDERING WHY
THE SKY’S BLUE 
THAT’S NOT MY BUSINESS
ALL I KNOW IS I 
LOOK UP AND TELL MYSELF 
BE PATIENT LOVE
IT COULD BE US

LOVERS USED TO MAKE LOVE
DIED JUST TO GIVE US 
THEIR PIECE OF THE BEAUTIFUL 
REMEMBER WHEN WE MADE LOVE
LOVE, WASN’T IT BEAUTIFUL

DON’T ASK ME WHY
THE SKY’S BLUE 
THAT’S NOT MY BUSINESS
ALL I KNOW IS I 
LOOK UP AND TELL MYSELF 
BE PATIENT LOVE
IT COULD BE US

DIAMONDS USED TO BE COAL
LOOK YOUNG ‘CAUSE GOT THEY GOT SOUL
AND MY HEART USED TO BE COLD
‘TIL YOUR HANDS LAID ON MY SOUL
SOMEBODY’S GOT TO STAY DEEP IN LOVE
THAT COULD BE US 
THAT’S WHY WE’RE BEAUTIFUL

THAT’S WHY YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL 
THAT’S WHY YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL 
THAT’S WHY YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL 
THAT’S WHY YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL

OHHH…



SCARED OF LONELY

I’M IN THIS FIGHT AND I’M SWINGING
AND MY ARMS ARE GETTING TIRED
I’M TRYING TO BEAT THIS EMPTINESS 
BUT I’M RUNNING OUT OF TIME
I’M SINKING IN THE SAND
AND I CAN BARELY STAND
AND I’M LOST IN THIS DREAM 
I NEED YOU TO HOLD ME

I’M SCARED OF LONELY

I TRY TO BE PATIENT 
BUT I’M HURTING DEEP INSIDE
AND I CAN’T KEEP WAITING
I NEED COMFORT LATE AT NIGHT
AND I CAN’T FIND MY WAY
WHY WON’T YOU LEAD ME HOME
‘CAUSE I’M LOST IN THIS DREAM
I NEED YOU TO HOLD ME

I’M SCARED OF LONELY

AND I’M SCARED OF BEING THE ONLY
SHADOW I SEE ALONG THE WALL
AND I’M SCARED THE ONLY HEART BEAT
I HEAR BEATING IS MY OWN 
AND I’M SCARED OF BEING ALONE 
I CAN’T SEEM TO BREATHE WHEN I AM LOST 
IN THIS DREAM I NEED YOU TO HOLD ME

I’M SCARED OF LONELY
I’M SCARED OF LONELY

I CRY AT NIGHT
‘CAUSE MY BABY’S
TOO FAR TO BE BY MY SIDE
TO WIPE AWAY THESE TEARS OF MINE
SO I HOLD MY PILLOW TIGHT
TO IMAGINE YOU 
OUTSTRETCH YOUR HAND 
LOOKING FOR MINE
‘CAUSE I’M LOST IN THIS DREAM 
I NEED YOU TO HOLD ME

I’M SCARED OF LONELY

AND I’M SCARED OF BEING THE ONLY
SHADOW I SEE ALONG THE WALL
AND I’M SCARED THE ONLY HEART BEAT
I HEAR BEATING IS MY OWN 
AND I’M SCARED OF BEING ALONE 
I CAN’T SEEM TO BREATHE WHEN I AM LOST 
IN THIS DREAM I NEED YOU TO HOLD ME

I NEED YOUR STRENGTH
WHEN NOBODY’S AROUND
‘CAUSE I’M TIRED OF THIS EMPTINESS
I THINK I’M DROWNING 
I CAN’T BE LONELY NO MORE
WHEN I’M LOST IN THIS DREAM
I NEED YOU TO HOLD ME

I’M SCARED OF LONELY

AND I’M SCARED OF BEING THE ONLY
SHADOW I SEE ALONG THE WALL
AND I’M SCARED THE ONLY HEART BEAT
I HEAR BEATING IS MY OWN 
AND I’M SCARED OF BEING ALONE 
I CAN’T SEEM TO BREATHE WHEN I AM LOST 
IN THIS DREAM I NEED YOU TO HOLD ME 
    

I’M SCARED OF LONELY
I’M SCARED OF LONELY

FLAWS AND ALL

I'M A TRAIN WRECK IN THE MORNING
I'M A BITCH IN THE AFTERNOON
EVERY NOW AND THEN WITHOUT WARNING
I CAN BE REALLY MEAN TOWARDS YOU

I'M A PUZZLE YES IN DEED
EVER COMPLEX IN EVERY WAY
AND ALL THE PIECES AREN'T EVEN IN THE BOX

I NEGLECT YOU WHEN I'M WORKING
WHEN I NEED ATTENTION, I TEND TO NAG
I'M A HOST OF IMPERFECTION
AND YOU SEE PAST ALL THAT
I'M A PEASANT BY SOME STANDARDS
BUT IN YOUR EYES, I'M A QUEEN
YOU SEE POTENTIAL IN ALL MY FLAWS
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN

I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU LOVE ME
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU
YOU CATCH ME WHEN I FALL
ACCEPT ME FLAWS AND ALL
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU 
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU

I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU LOVE ME
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU
CATCH ME WHEN I FALL
ACCEPT ME FLAWS AND ALL
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU 
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU

RESENTMENT

I WISH I COULD BELIEVE YOU
THEN I'LL BE ALRIGHT
BUT NOW EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME
REALLY DON'T APPLY
TO THE WAY I FEEL INSIDE
LOVING YOU WAS EASY 
ONCE UPON A TIME
BUT NOW MY SUSPICIONS OF YOU
HAVE MULTIPLIED
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE YOU LIED

I ONLY GIVE YOU A HARD TIME
‘CAUSE I CAN’T GO ON AND PRETEND LIKE 
I HAVEN’T TRIED TO FORGIVE THIS 
BUT I’M MUCH TOO FULL OF RESENTMENT
JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET OVER
THE WAY YOU HURT ME
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GAVE ANOTHER
WHO DIDN'T MEAN A THING, NO
THE VERY THING YOU GAVE TO ME

I THOUGHT I COULD FORGIVE YOU
AND I KNOW YOU'VE CHANGED
AS MUCH AS I WANNA TRUST YOU
I KNOW IT AIN'T THE SAME
AND IT’S ALL BECAUSE YOU LIED

I ONLY GIVE YOU A HARD TIME
‘CAUSE I CAN’T GO ON AND PRETEND LIKE 
I HAVEN’T TRIED TO FORGIVE THIS 
BUT I’M MUCH TOO FULL OF RESENTMENT

I MAY NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY
I’M DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN
I TRIED AND I TRIED TO FORGIVE THIS
BUT I’M MUCH TOO FULL OF RESENTMENT

I ALWAYS REMEMBER FEELIN’
LIKE I WAS NO GOOD
LIKE I COULDN'T DO IT FOR YOU
LIKE YOUR MISTRESS COULD
AND IT’S ALL BECAUSE YOU LIED

LOVED YOU MORE THAN EVER
MORE THAN MY OWN LIFE
THE BEST PART OF ME I GAVE YOU
IT WAS SACRIFICED
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE YOU LIED

I ONLY GIVE YOU A HARD TIME
‘CAUSE I CAN’T GO ON AND PRETEND LIKE 
I TRIED AND I TRIED TO FORGIVE THIS 
BUT I’M MUCH TOO DAMN FULL OF RESENTMENT

I KNOW SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE
BUT I WAS HERE FIRST
BEEN RIDING WITH YOU FOR 6 YEARS
WHY DID I DESERVE
TO BE TREATED THIS WAY BY YOU
I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING
WHAT'S UP WITH B
I’VE BEEN CRYING FOR TOO LONG 
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME
I USED TO BE SO STRONG
NOW YOU TOOK MY SOUL
I’M CRYING
CAN’T STOP CRYING
CAN’T STOP CRYING
YOU COULD’VE TOLD ME
YOU WASN’T HAPPY
I KNOW YOU DIDN’T WANT TO HURT ME
LOOK AT WHAT YOU’VE DONE TO ME NOW
I GOTTA LOOK AT HER IN HER EYES
AND SEE SHE’S HAD HALF OF ME
YOU LIED
HOW COULD YOU LIE
YOU LIED

I FOLLOWED THE VOICE YOU GAVE TO ME
BUT NOW I GOTTA FIND MY OWN

YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
THERE IS SOMEONE HERE INSIDE
SOMEONE I'D THOUGHT HAD DIED
SO LONG AGO

OH, I'M SCREAMING OUT, AND MY DREAMS WILL BE HEARD 
THEY WILL NOT BE PUSHED ASIDE ON WORDS 
INTO YOUR OWN
ALL CAUSE YOU WON'T
LISTEN

LISTEN, I AM ALONE AT A CROSSROADS
I'M NOT AT HOME, IN MY OWN HOME
AND I'VE TRIED AND TRIED
TO SAY WHAT'S ON MY MIND
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

OH, NOW I'M DONE BELIEVING YOU

THAT’S HOW I LIKE IT, BABY

I LIKE THE WAY YOU WALK
THE WAY YOU TALK
THE WAY YOU DRESS
THE WAY YOU SMILE

I LIKE THE WAY YOU ARE
THE WAY YOU AIN’T
I LIKE YOUR HONESTY, INTEGRITY, IT LEVELS ME
SO PLEASE DON’T EVER CHANGE

THAT’S HOW YOU LIKE IT, HUH
THAT’S HOW YOU LIKE IT, HUH
THAT’S HOW YOU LIKE IT, HUH
THAT’S HOW I LIKE IT BABY
(4X)

I LIKE THE WAY YOU BRUSH YOUR HAIR
I LIKE THE STYLISH CLOTHES YOU WEAR
IT’S JUST THE REAL THINGS YOU DO
THAT’S WHY I WANNA STICK WITH YOU

WHERE MY GIRLS AT
LET THEM KNOW WE LOVE THAT
SEXY WAY THEY DOES THAT 
THAT’S HOW I LIKE IT BABY

I HOPE YOU LIKE MY STYLE
THE WAY I DRESS

I KNOW YOU’VE HEARD I’M A GANGSTA
THEY SAY STAY AWAY FROM THEM GANGSTAS
THEY NEVER CHANGE UP, OR PULL THEY PANTS UP
WELL, BABY GIRL, PUT YA FOOT DOWN
DON’T LET ‘EM PUSH YOU AROUND, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE
BABY THUG, YOU KNOW WRONG FROM RIGHT
YOU DONE FELT WRONG BEFORE
THIS CAN’T BE WHAT IT FEEL LIKE
AND THEY DON’T REALLY KNOW WHATCHA FEEL LIKE, FOR INSTANCE
THEY DON’T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REAL LIFE
AND THE MUSIC VIDEOS AND THE RAGGEDY MAGAZINES
THEY HAVE IT BADDER THAN HE SEEMS
ALL THEY SEE IS MY BAGGY JEANS, MY ATTITUDE
I AIN’T MAD AT YOU, IT’S JUST MY CLYDE
WAY I WEAR MY HAT TO THE SIDE
WAY I LEAN REAL LOW WHEN I RIDE
THAT’S WHY MY MINDS, THEY LIKE MY WALK
MY ACCENT FROM NEW YORK
MY WAY OF THINKING IS SLIGHTLY OFF
THEY LIKE THE WAY HE FLOSS
LEAVE THE BLOCK ON A BIKE, HE COME BACK ON A PORSCHE
BUT OF COURSE
MOST OF ALL, THEY LIKE MY HONESTY, INTEGRITY, MY LOYALTY
YOUNG HOV AND THE LETTER B
HOW YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?

THAT’S HOW YOU LIKE IT, HUH
THAT’S HOW YOU LIKE IT, HUH
THAT’S HOW YOU LIKE IT, HUH
THAT’S HOW I LIKE IT BABY
(4X)

IF YOU WEREN'T BY MY SIDE

YOU'RE MY RELATION
IN CONNECTION TO THE SUN
WITH YOU NEXT TO ME
THERE'S NO DARKNESS I CAN'T OVERCOME

YOU ARE MY RAINDROP
I AM THE SEED
WITH YOU AND GOD, WHO'S MY SUNLIGHT 
I BLOOM AND GROW SO BEAUTIFULLY

BABY, I'M SO PROUD
SO PROUD TO BE YOUR GIRL
YOU MAKE THE CONFUSION
GO ALL AWAY
FROM THIS COLD AND MIXED UP WORLD

I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU
YOU SET ME FREE
I CAN'T DO THIS THING
CALLED LIFE WITHOUT YOU HERE WITH ME

‘CAUSE I'M DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE WITH YOU
I'LL NEVER LEAVE
JUST KEEP LOVING ME
THE WAY I LOVE, YOU LOVING ME
    

AND I KNOW YOU LOVE ME
LOVE ME FOR WHO I AM
CAUSE YEARS BEFORE I BECAME WHO I AM
BABY YOU WERE MY MAN

I KNOW IT AIN'T EASY
EASY LOVING ME
I APPRECIATE THE LOVE AND DEDICATION
FROM YOU TO ME

LATER ON IN MY DESTINY
I SEE MYSELF HAVING YOUR CHILD
I SEE MYSELF BEING YOUR WIFE
AND I SEE MY WHOLE FUTURE IN YOUR EYES

THOUGHT OF ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU
SOMETIMES MAKE ME WANNA CRY
REALIZE ALL MY BLESSINGS
I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOU BY MY SIDE

I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU
YOU SET ME FREE

CALLED LIFE WITHOUT YOU HERE WITH ME

‘CAUSE I'M DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE WITH YOU
I'LL NEVER LEAVE

EVERY TIME I SEE YOUR FACE 
MY HEART SMILES
EVERY TIME IT FEELS SO GOOD
IT HURTS SOMETIMES
CREATED IN THIS WORLD
TO LOVE
TO HOLD
TO FEEL
TO BREATHE
TO LOVE YOU

I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU
YOU SET ME FREE
I CAN'T DO THIS THING
CALLED LIFE WITHOUT YOU HERE WITH ME

‘CAUSE I'M DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE WITH YOU
I'LL NEVER LEAVE
JUST KEEP LOVING ME
THE WAY I LOVE, YOU LOVING ME

I BELIEVE THAT HARMONIES ARE COLORS
EVERY TIME I PAINT, IT SHARPENS MY HARMONY
YESTERDAY I TRIED TO PAINT YOU, BUT THE COLORS WEREN’T BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH
YOUR LOVE GOES BEYOND WHAT I CAN SAY
LOVE BEYONCÉ



GIFT FROM VIRGO

A GIFT, A GIFT FROM VIRGO

I WISH I COULD LOOK IN YOUR EYES
AND TELL YOU HOW I FEEL 
RIGHT NOW INSIDE
BABY I KNOW THAT IT'S REAL
SO REAL, SO REAL, SO REAL
HOW I WISH I COULD BE WITH YOU 
HOW I WISH, HOW I WISH, HOW I WISH I COULD BE WITH YOU RIGHT NOW

EVERY MORNING, EVERY AFTERNOON, EVERY NIGHT
I WANNA BE WITH YOU
IT DON'T MATTER IF WE GO TO THE PARK OR WATCH A PLAY
STAY IN THE HOTEL ROOM ALL DAY
I JUST WANNA BE WITH YOU

I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
FROM YOUR OLD SCHOOL TENNIS SHOES
TO THE WAY YOU MOVE WHEN YOU'RE DANCING WITH ME

DO YOU REMEMBER OUR FIRST KISS
IT WASN'T LONG ENOUGH
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME 
WE SPENT THOSE WEEKS TOGETHER
THEY WERE NOT LONG ENOUGH

ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS
ALL OF YOUR SWEET PAGES
THEY'RE NEVER LONG ENOUGH

WHEN IT'S TIME FOR ME TO LEAVE
IT'S SO HARD TO SAY GOOD-BYE
I NEVER WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE
I NEVER EVER WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE

ONE DAY, ONE DAY WE'LL MAKE LOVE
FINALLY I’LL BE YOURS
ONLY YOU, ONLY YOU 
I COULD LOVE YOU
IT'S TOO LATE 
I ALREADY LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU 
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU



DADDY

I REMEMBER WHEN YOU USE TO TAKE ME ON A BIKE RIDE EVERYDAY ON THE BAYOU 
(YOU REMEMBER THAT? WE WERE INSEPARABLE)
AND I REMEMBER WHEN YOU COULD DO NO WRONG
YOU'D COME HOME FROM WORK AND I JUMPED IN YOUR ARMS WHEN I SAW YOU
I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU (I WAS SO EXCITED, SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU)

BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME I OVERCOME
AND I'M SO PROUD OF WHAT YOU'VE BECOME
YOU'VE GIVEN ME SUCH SECURITY
NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKES I MAKE, YOU'RE THERE FOR ME
YOU CURE MY DISAPPOINTMENTS AND YOU HEAL MY PAIN
YOU UNDERSTOOD MY FEARS AND YOU PROTECTED ME
TREASURE EVERY IRREPLACEABLE MEMORY AND THAT'S WHY…

I WANT MY UNBORN SON TO BE LIKE MY DADDY
I WANT MY HUSBAND TO BE LIKE MY DADDY
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE MY DADDY
AND I THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME

I STILL REMEMBER THE EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT I'D BEEN ON A DATE AND HAD A BOYFRIEND 
(MY FIRST BOYFRIEND, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE)
I STILL REMEMBER I CAUGHT YOU CRYING ‘CAUSE OF MY TATTOO
COULD HAVE SAID BEYONCE I TOLD YOU SO
INSTEAD YOU SAID YOU'D GET ONE TOO 
(EVEN MY MAMA SAID Y'ALL GET ONE JUST LIKE MINE)

WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS MY BOUNDLESS GRATITUDE FOR YOU
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
YOU'VE GIVEN ME SUCH SECURITY
NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKES, I KNOW YOU'RE THERE FOR ME
YOU CURE MY DISAPPOINTMENTS AND YOU HEAL MY PAIN
YOU UNDERSTAND MY FEARS AND YOU PROTECTED ME
TREASURE EVERY EXTRAORDINARY MEMORY AND THAT'S WHY…

I WANT MY UNBORN SON TO BE LIKE MY DADDY
I WANT MY HUSBAND TO BE LIKE MY DADDY
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE MY DADDY
AND I THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME

EVEN IF MY MAN BROKE MY HEART TODAY
NO MATTER HOW MUCH PAIN I'M IN, I WILL BE OKAY
CAUSE I GOT A MAN IN MY LIFE THAT CAN'T BE REPLACED
FOR THIS LOVE IS UNCONDITIONAL IT WON'T GO AWAY

I KNOW I'M LUCKY
KNOW IT AIN'T EASY
FOR MEN WHO TAKE CARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES
LOVE IS OVERWHELMING
LORD WHY DID YOU PICK ME
CAN'T STOP MY TEARS FROM FALLING
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH DADDY

THANK YOU, YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR ME. 
I LOVE YOU DADDY.

I GET SO EMOTIONAL DADDY, EVERY TIME I THINK OF YOU
I GET SO EMOTIONAL DADDY, EVERY TIME I THINK OF YOU
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE MY DADDY
NO ONE ELSE REPLACE MY DADDY...
