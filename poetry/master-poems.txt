SEA GARDEN

SEA ROSE


    Rose, harsh rose,
    marred and with stint of petals,
    meagre flower, thin,
    sparse of leaf,

    more precious
    than a wet rose
    single on a stem--
    you are caught in the drift.

    Stunted, with small leaf,
    you are flung on the sand,
    you are lifted
    in the crisp sand
    that drives in the wind.

    Can the spice-rose
    drip such acrid fragrance
    hardened in a leaf?




THE HELMSMAN


    O be swift--
    we have always known you wanted us.

    We fled inland with our flocks,
    we pastured them in hollows,
    cut off from the wind
    and the salt track of the marsh.

    We worshipped inland--
    we stepped past wood-flowers,
    we forgot your tang,
    we brushed wood-grass.

    We wandered from pine-hills
    through oak and scrub-oak tangles,
    we broke hyssop and bramble,
    we caught flower and new bramble-fruit
    in our hair: we laughed
    as each branch whipped back,
    we tore our feet in half buried rocks
    and knotted roots and acorn-cups.

    We forgot--we worshipped,
    we parted green from green,
    we sought further thickets,
    we dipped our ankles
    through leaf-mould and earth,
    and wood and wood-bank enchanted us--

    and the feel of the clefts in the bark,
    and the slope between tree and tree--
    and a slender path strung field to field
    and wood to wood
    and hill to hill
    and the forest after it.

    We forgot--for a moment
    tree-resin, tree-bark,
    sweat of a torn branch
    were sweet to the taste.

    We were enchanted with the fields,
    the tufts of coarse grass
    in the shorter grass--
    we loved all this.

    But now, our boat climbs--hesitates--drops--
    climbs--hesitates--crawls back--
    climbs--hesitates--
    O be swift--
    we have always known you wanted us.




THE SHRINE

("SHE WATCHES OVER THE SEA")


    I

    Are your rocks shelter for ships--
    have you sent galleys from your beach,
    are you graded--a safe crescent--
    where the tide lifts them back to port--
    are you full and sweet,
    tempting the quiet
    to depart in their trading ships?

    Nay, you are great, fierce, evil--
    you are the land-blight--
    you have tempted men
    but they perished on your cliffs.

    Your lights are but dank shoals,
    slate and pebble and wet shells
    and seaweed fastened to the rocks.

    It was evil--evil
    when they found you,
    when the quiet men looked at you--
    they sought a headland
    shaded with ledge of cliff
    from the wind-blast.

    But you--you are unsheltered,
    cut with the weight of wind--
    you shudder when it strikes,
    then lift, swelled with the blast--
    you sink as the tide sinks,
    you shrill under hail, and sound
    thunder when thunder sounds.
    You are useless--
    when the tides swirl
    your boulders cut and wreck
    the staggering ships.


    II

    You are useless,
    O grave, O beautiful,
    the landsmen tell it--I have heard--
    you are useless.

    And the wind sounds with this
    and the sea
    where rollers shot with blue
    cut under deeper blue.

    O but stay tender, enchanted
    where wave-lengths cut you
    apart from all the rest--
    for we have found you,
    we watch the splendour of you,
    we thread throat on throat of freesia
    for your shelf.

    You are not forgot,
    O plunder of lilies,
    honey is not more sweet
    than the salt stretch of your beach.


    III

    Stay--stay--
    but terror has caught us now,
    we passed the men in ships,
    we dared deeper than the fisher-folk
    and you strike us with terror
    O bright shaft.

    Flame passes under us
    and sparks that unknot the flesh,
    sorrow, splitting bone from bone,
    splendour athwart our eyes
    and rifts in the splendour,
    sparks and scattered light.

    Many warned of this,
    men said:
    there are wrecks on the fore-beach,
    wind will beat your ship,
    there is no shelter in that headland,
    it is useless waste, that edge,
    that front of rock--
    sea-gulls clang beyond the breakers,
    none venture to that spot.


    IV

    But hail--
    as the tide slackens,
    as the wind beats out,
    we hail this shore--
    we sing to you,
    spirit between the headlands
    and the further rocks.

    Though oak-beams split,
    though boats and sea-men flounder,
    and the strait grind sand with sand
    and cut boulders to sand and drift--

    your eyes have pardoned our faults,
    your hands have touched us--
    you have leaned forward a little
    and the waves can never thrust us back
    from the splendour of your ragged coast.




MID-DAY


    The light beats upon me.
    I am startled--
    a split leaf crackles on the paved floor--
    I am anguished--defeated.

    A slight wind shakes the seed-pods--
    my thoughts are spent
    as the black seeds.
    My thoughts tear me,
    I dread their fever.
    I am scattered in its whirl.
    I am scattered like
    the hot shrivelled seeds.

    The shrivelled seeds
    are spilt on the path--
    the grass bends with dust,
    the grape slips
    under its crackled leaf:
    yet far beyond the spent seed-pods,
    and the blackened stalks of mint,
    the poplar is bright on the hill,
    the poplar spreads out,
    deep-rooted among trees.

    O poplar, you are great
    among the hill-stones,
    while I perish on the path
    among the crevices of the rocks.




PURSUIT


    What do I care
    that the stream is trampled,
    the sand on the stream-bank
    still holds the print of your foot:
    the heel is cut deep.
    I see another mark
    on the grass ridge of the bank--
    it points toward the wood-path.
    I have lost the third
    in the packed earth.

    But here
    a wild-hyacinth stalk is snapped:
    the purple buds--half ripe--
    show deep purple
    where your heel pressed.

    A patch of flowering grass,
    low, trailing--
    you brushed this:
    the green stems show yellow-green
    where you lifted--turned the earth-side
    to the light:
    this and a dead leaf-spine,
    split across,
    show where you passed.

    You were swift, swift!
    here the forest ledge slopes--
    rain has furrowed the roots.
    Your hand caught at this;
    the root snapped under your weight.

    I can almost follow the note
    where it touched this slender tree
    and the next answered--
    and the next.

    And you climbed yet further!
    you stopped by the dwarf-cornel--
    whirled on your heels,
    doubled on your track.

    This is clear--
    you fell on the downward slope,
    you dragged a bruised thigh--you limped--
    you clutched this larch.

    Did your head, bent back,
    search further--
    clear through the green leaf-moss
    of the larch branches?

    Did you clutch,
    stammer with short breath and gasp:
    _wood-daemons grant life--
    give life--I am almost lost._

    For some wood-daemon
    has lightened your steps.
    I can find no trace of you
    in the larch-cones and the underbrush.




THE CONTEST



    I

    Your stature is modelled
    with straight tool-edge:
    you are chiselled like rocks
    that are eaten into by the sea.

    With the turn and grasp of your wrist
    and the chords' stretch,
    there is a glint like worn brass.

    The ridge of your breast is taut,
    and under each the shadow is sharp,
    and between the clenched muscles
    of your slender hips.

    From the circle of your cropped hair
    there is light,
    and about your male torse
    and the foot-arch and the straight ankle.


    II

    You stand rigid and mighty--
    granite and the ore in rocks;
    a great band clasps your forehead
    and its heavy twists of gold.

    You are white--a limb of cypress
    bent under a weight of snow.

    You are splendid,
    your arms are fire;
    you have entered the hill-straits--
    a sea treads upon the hill-slopes.


    III

    Myrtle is about your head,
    you have bent and caught the spray:
    each leaf is sharp
    against the lift and furrow
    of your bound hair.

    The narcissus has copied the arch
    of your slight breast:
    your feet are citron-flowers,
    your knees, cut from white-ash,
    your thighs are rock-cistus.

    Your chin lifts straight
    from the hollow of your curved throat.
    Your shoulders are level--
    they have melted rare silver
    for their breadth.




SEA LILY


    Reed,
    slashed and torn
    but doubly rich--
    such great heads as yours
    drift upon temple-steps,
    but you are shattered
    in the wind.

    Myrtle-bark
    is flecked from you,
    scales are dashed
    from your stem,
    sand cuts your petal,
    furrows it with hard edge,
    like flint
    on a bright stone.

    Yet though the whole wind
    slash at your bark,
    you are lifted up,
    aye--though it hiss
    to cover you with froth.




THE WIND SLEEPERS


    Whiter
    than the crust
    left by the tide,
    we are stung by the hurled sand
    and the broken shells.

    We no longer sleep
    in the wind--
    we awoke and fled
    through the city gate.

    Tear--
    tear us an altar,
    tug at the cliff-boulders,
    pile them with the rough stones--
    we no longer
    sleep in the wind,
    propitiate us.

    Chant in a wail
    that never halts,
    pace a circle and pay tribute
    with a song.

    When the roar of a dropped wave
    breaks into it,
    pour meted words
    of sea-hawks and gulls
    and sea-birds that cry
    discords.




THE GIFT


    Instead of pearls--a wrought clasp--
    a bracelet--will you accept this?

    You know the script--
    you will start, wonder:
    what is left, what phrase
    after last night? This:

    The world is yet unspoiled for you,
    you wait, expectant--
    you are like the children
    who haunt your own steps
    for chance bits--a comb
    that may have slipped,
    a gold tassel, unravelled,
    plucked from your scarf,
    twirled by your slight fingers
    into the street--
    a flower dropped.

    Do not think me unaware,
    I who have snatched at you
    as the street-child clutched
    at the seed-pearls you spilt
    that hot day
    when your necklace snapped.

    Do not dream that I speak
    as one defrauded of delight,
    sick, shaken by each heart-beat
    or paralyzed, stretched at length,
    who gasps:
    these ripe pears
    are bitter to the taste,
    this spiced wine, poison, corrupt.
    I cannot walk--
    who would walk?
    Life is a scavenger's pit--I escape--
    I only, rejecting it,
    lying here on this couch.

    Your garden sloped to the beach,
    myrtle overran the paths,
    honey and amber flecked each leaf,
    the citron-lily head--
    one among many--
    weighed there, over-sweet.

    The myrrh-hyacinth
    spread across low slopes,
    violets streaked black ridges
    through the grass.

    The house, too, was like this,
    over painted, over lovely--
    the world is like this.

    Sleepless nights,
    I remember the initiates,
    their gesture, their calm glance.
    I have heard how in rapt thought,
    in vision, they speak
    with another race,
    more beautiful, more intense than this.
    I could laugh--
    more beautiful, more intense?

    Perhaps that other life
    is contrast always to this.
    I reason:
    I have lived as they
    in their inmost rites--
    they endure the tense nerves
    through the moment of ritual.
    I endure from moment to moment--
    days pass all alike,
    tortured, intense.

    This I forgot last night:
    you must not be blamed,
    it is not your fault;
    as a child, a flower--any flower
    tore my breast--
    meadow-chicory, a common grass-tip,
    a leaf shadow, a flower tint
    unexpected on a winter-branch.

    I reason:
    another life holds what this lacks,
    a sea, unmoving, quiet--
    not forcing our strength
    to rise to it, beat on beat--
    stretch of sand,
    no garden beyond, strangling
    with its myrrh-lilies--
    a hill, not set with black violets
    but stones, stones, bare rocks,
    dwarf-trees, twisted, no beauty
    to distract--to crowd
    madness upon madness.

    Only a still place
    and perhaps some outer horror
    some hideousness to stamp beauty,
    a mark--no changing it now--
    on our hearts.

    I send no string of pearls,
    no bracelet--accept this.




EVENING


    The light passes
    from ridge to ridge,
    from flower to flower--
    the hypaticas, wide-spread
    under the light
    grow faint--
    the petals reach inward,
    the blue tips bend
    toward the bluer heart
    and the flowers are lost.

    The cornel-buds are still white,
    but shadows dart
    from the cornel-roots--
    black creeps from root to root,
    each leaf
    cuts another leaf on the grass,
    shadow seeks shadow,
    then both leaf
    and leaf-shadow are lost.




SHELTERED GARDEN


    I have had enough.
    I gasp for breath.

    Every way ends, every road,
    every foot-path leads at last
    to the hill-crest--
    then you retrace your steps,
    or find the same slope on the other side,
    precipitate.

    I have had enough--
    border-pinks, clove-pinks, wax-lilies,
    herbs, sweet-cress.

    O for some sharp swish of a branch--
    there is no scent of resin
    in this place,
    no taste of bark, of coarse weeds,
    aromatic, astringent--
    only border on border of scented pinks.

    Have you seen fruit under cover
    that wanted light--
    pears wadded in cloth,
    protected from the frost,
    melons, almost ripe,
    smothered in straw?

    Why not let the pears cling
    to the empty branch?
    All your coaxing will only make
    a bitter fruit--
    let them cling, ripen of themselves,
    test their own worth,
    nipped, shrivelled by the frost,
    to fall at last but fair
    with a russet coat.

    Or the melon--
    let it bleach yellow
    in the winter light,
    even tart to the taste--
    it is better to taste of frost--
    the exquisite frost--
    than of wadding and of dead grass.

    For this beauty,
    beauty without strength,
    chokes out life.
    I want wind to break,
    scatter these pink-stalks,
    snap off their spiced heads,
    fling them about with dead leaves--
    spread the paths with twigs,
    limbs broken off,
    trail great pine branches,
    hurled from some far wood
    right across the melon-patch,
    break pear and quince--
    leave half-trees, torn, twisted
    but showing the fight was valiant.

    O to blot out this garden
    to forget, to find a new beauty
    in some terrible
    wind-tortured place.




SEA POPPIES


    Amber husk
    fluted with gold,
    fruit on the sand
    marked with a rich grain,

    treasure
    spilled near the shrub-pines
    to bleach on the boulders:

    your stalk has caught root
    among wet pebbles
    and drift flung by the sea
    and grated shells
    and split conch-shells.

    Beautiful, wide-spread,
    fire upon leaf,
    what meadow yields
    so fragrant a leaf
    as your bright leaf?




LOSS


    The sea called--
    you faced the estuary,
    you were drowned as the tide passed.--
    I am glad of this--
    at least you have escaped.

    The heavy sea-mist stifles me.
    I choke with each breath--
    a curious peril, this--
    the gods have invented
    curious torture for us.

    One of us, pierced in the flank,
    dragged himself across the marsh,
    he tore at the bay-roots,
    lost hold on the crumbling bank--

    Another crawled--too late--
    for shelter under the cliffs.

    I am glad the tide swept you out,
    O beloved,
    you of all this ghastly host
    alone untouched,
    your white flesh covered with salt
    as with myrrh and burnt iris.

    We were hemmed in this place,
    so few of us, so few of us to fight
    their sure lances,
    the straight thrust--effortless
    with slight life of muscle and shoulder.

    So straight--only we were left,
    the four of us--somehow shut off.

    And the marsh dragged one back,
    and another perished under the cliff,
    and the tide swept you out.

    Your feet cut steel on the paths,
    I followed for the strength
    of life and grasp.
    I have seen beautiful feet
    but never beauty welded with strength.
    I marvelled at your height.

    You stood almost level
    with the lance-bearers
    and so slight.

    And I wondered as you clasped
    your shoulder-strap
    at the strength of your wrist
    and the turn of your young fingers,
    and the lift of your shorn locks,
    and the bronze
    of your sun-burnt neck.

    All of this,
    and the curious knee-cap,
    fitted above the wrought greaves,
    and the sharp muscles of your back
    which the tunic could not cover--
    the outline
    no garment could deface.

    I wonder if you knew how I watched,
    how I crowded before the spearsmen--
    but the gods wanted you,
    the gods wanted you back.




HUNTRESS


    Come, blunt your spear with us,
    our pace is hot
    and our bare heels
    in the heel-prints--
    we stand tense--do you see--
    are you already beaten
    by the chase?

    We lead the pace
    for the wind on the hills,
    the low hill is spattered
    with loose earth--
    our feet cut into the crust
    as with spears.

    We climbed the ploughed land,
    dragged the seed from the clefts,
    broke the clods with our heels,
    whirled with a parched cry
    into the woods:

    _Can you come,
    can you come,
    can you follow the hound trail,
    can you trample the hot froth?_

    Spring up--sway forward--
    follow the quickest one,
    aye, though you leave the trail
    and drop exhausted at our feet.




GARDEN


    I

    You are clear
    O rose, cut in rock,
    hard as the descent of hail.

    I could scrape the colour
    from the petals
    like spilt dye from a rock.

    If I could break you
    I could break a tree.

    If I could stir
    I could break a tree--
    I could break you.


    II

    O wind, rend open the heat,
    cut apart the heat,
    rend it to tatters.

    Fruit cannot drop
    through this thick air--
    fruit cannot fall into heat
    that presses up and blunts
    the points of pears
    and rounds the grapes.

    Cut the heat--
    plough through it,
    turning it on either side
    of your path.




SEA VIOLET


    The white violet
    is scented on its stalk,
    the sea-violet
    fragile as agate,
    lies fronting all the wind
    among the torn shells
    on the sand-bank.

    The greater blue violets
    flutter on the hill,
    but who would change for these
    who would change for these
    one root of the white sort?

    Violet
    your grasp is frail
    on the edge of the sand-hill,
    but you catch the light--
    frost, a star edges with its fire.




THE CLIFF TEMPLE


    I

    Great, bright portal,
    shelf of rock,
    rocks fitted in long ledges,
    rocks fitted to dark, to silver granite,
    to lighter rock--
    clean cut, white against white.

    High--high--and no hill-goat
    tramples--no mountain-sheep
    has set foot on your fine grass;
    you lift, you are the world-edge,
    pillar for the sky-arch.

    The world heaved--
    we are next to the sky:
    over us, sea-hawks shout,
    gulls sweep past--
    the terrible breakers are silent
    from this place.

    Below us, on the rock-edge,
    where earth is caught in the fissures
    of the jagged cliff,
    a small tree stiffens in the gale,
    it bends--but its white flowers
    are fragrant at this height.

    And under and under,
    the wind booms:
    it whistles, it thunders,
    it growls--it presses the grass
    beneath its great feet.


    II

    I said:
    for ever and for ever, must I follow you
    through the stones?
    I catch at you--you lurch:
    you are quicker than my hand-grasp.

    I wondered at you.
    I shouted--dear--mysterious--beautiful--
    white myrtle-flesh.

    I was splintered and torn:
    the hill-path mounted
    swifter than my feet.

    Could a daemon avenge this hurt,
    I would cry to him--could a ghost,
    I would shout--O evil,
    follow this god,
    taunt him with his evil and his vice.


    III

    Shall I hurl myself from here,
    shall I leap and be nearer you?
    Shall I drop, beloved, beloved,
    ankle against ankle?
    Would you pity me, O white breast?

    If I woke, would you pity me,
    would our eyes meet?

    Have you heard,
    do you know how I climbed this rock?
    My breath caught, I lurched forward--
    stumbled in the ground-myrtle.

    Have you heard, O god seated on the cliff,
    how far toward the ledges of your house,
    how far I had to walk?


    IV

    Over me the wind swirls.
    I have stood on your portal
    and I know--
    you are further than this,
    still further on another cliff.




ORCHARD


    I saw the first pear
    as it fell--
    the honey-seeking, golden-banded,
    the yellow swarm
    was not more fleet than I,
    (spare us from loveliness)
    and I fell prostrate
    crying:
    you have flayed us
    with your blossoms,
    spare us the beauty
    of fruit-trees.

    The honey-seeking
    paused not,
    the air thundered their song,
    and I alone was prostrate.

    O rough-hewn
    god of the orchard,
    I bring you an offering--
    do you, alone unbeautiful,
    son of the god,
    spare us from loveliness:

    these fallen hazel-nuts,
    stripped late of their green sheaths,
    grapes, red-purple,
    their berries
    dripping with wine,
    pomegranates already broken,
    and shrunken figs
    and quinces untouched,
    I bring you as offering.




SEA GODS


    I

    They say there is no hope--
    sand--drift--rocks--rubble of the sea--
    the broken hulk of a ship,
    hung with shreds of rope,
    pallid under the cracked pitch.

    They say there is no hope
    to conjure you--
    no whip of the tongue to anger you--
    no hate of words
    you must rise to refute.

    They say you are twisted by the sea,
    you are cut apart
    by wave-break upon wave-break,
    that you are misshapen by the sharp rocks,
    broken by the rasp and after-rasp.

    That you are cut, torn, mangled,
    torn by the stress and beat,
    no stronger than the strips of sand
    along your ragged beach.


    II

    But we bring violets,
    great masses--single, sweet,
    wood-violets, stream-violets,
    violets from a wet marsh.

    Violets in clumps from hills,
    tufts with earth at the roots,
    violets tugged from rocks,
    blue violets, moss, cliff, river-violets.

    Yellow violets' gold,
    burnt with a rare tint--
    violets like red ash
    among tufts of grass.

    We bring deep-purple
    bird-foot violets.

    We bring the hyacinth-violet,
    sweet, bare, chill to the touch--
    and violets whiter than the in-rush
    of your own white surf.


    III

    For you will come,
    you will yet haunt men in ships,
    you will trail across the fringe of strait
    and circle the jagged rocks.

    You will trail across the rocks
    and wash them with your salt,
    you will curl between sand-hills--
    you will thunder along the cliff--
    break--retreat--get fresh strength--
    gather and pour weight upon the beach.

    You will draw back,
    and the ripple on the sand-shelf
    will be witness of your track.
    O privet-white, you will paint
    the lintel of wet sand with froth.

    You will bring myrrh-bark
    and drift laurel-wood from hot coasts!
    when you hurl high--high--
    we will answer with a shout.

    For you will come,
    you will come,
    you will answer our taut hearts,
    you will break the lie of men's thoughts,
    and cherish and shelter us.




ACON


    I

    Bear me to Dictaeus,
    and to the steep slopes;
    to the river Erymanthus.

    I choose spray of dittany,
    cyperum, frail of flower,
    buds of myrrh,
    all-healing herbs,
    close pressed in calathes.

    For she lies panting,
    drawing sharp breath,
    broken with harsh sobs,
    she, Hyella,
    whom no god pities.


    II

    Dryads
    haunting the groves,
    nereids
    who dwell in wet caves,
    for all the white leaves of olive-branch,
    and early roses,
    and ivy wreaths, woven gold berries,
    which she once brought to your altars,
    bear now ripe fruits from Arcadia,
    and Assyrian wine
    to shatter her fever.

    The light of her face falls from its flower,
    as a hyacinth,
    hidden in a far valley,
    perishes upon burnt grass.

    Pales,
    bring gifts,
    bring your Phoenician stuffs,
    and do you, fleet-footed nymphs,
    bring offerings,
    Illyrian iris,
    and a branch of shrub,
    and frail-headed poppies.




NIGHT


    The night has cut
    each from each
    and curled the petals
    back from the stalk
    and under it in crisp rows;

    under at an unfaltering pace,
    under till the rinds break,
    back till each bent leaf
    is parted from its stalk;

    under at a grave pace,
    under till the leaves
    are bent back
    till they drop upon earth,
    back till they are all broken.

    O night,
    you take the petals
    of the roses in your hand,
    but leave the stark core
    of the rose
    to perish on the branch.




PRISONERS


    It is strange that I should want
    this sight of your face--
    we have had so much:
    at any moment now I may pass,
    stand near the gate,
    do not speak--
    only reach if you can, your face
    half-fronting the passage
    toward the light.

    Fate--God sends this as a mark,
    a last token that we are not forgot,
    lost in this turmoil,
    about to be crushed out,
    burned or stamped out
    at best with sudden death.

    The spearsman who brings this
    will ask for the gold clasp
    you wear under your coat.
    I gave all I had left.

    Press close to the portal,
    my gate will soon clang
    and your fellow wretches
    will crowd to the entrance--
    be first at the gate.

    Ah beloved, do not speak.
    I write this in great haste--
    do not speak,
    you may yet be released.
    I am glad enough to depart
    though I have never tasted life
    as in these last weeks.

    It is a strange life,
    patterned in fire and letters
    on the prison pavement.
    If I glance up
    it is written on the walls,
    it is cut on the floor,
    it is patterned across
    the slope of the roof.

    I am weak--weak--
    last night if the guard
    had left the gate unlocked
    I could not have ventured to escape,
    but one thought serves me now
    with strength.

    As I pass down the corridor
    past desperate faces at each cell,
    your eyes and my eyes may meet.

    You will be dark, unkempt,
    but I pray for one glimpse of your face--
    why do I want this?
    I who have seen you at the banquet
    each flower of your hyacinth-circlet
    white against your hair.

    Why do I want this,
    when even last night
    you startled me from sleep?
    You stood against the dark rock,
    you grasped an elder staff.

    So many nights
    you have distracted me from terror.
    Once you lifted a spear-flower.
    I remember how you stooped
    to gather it--
    and it flamed, the leaf and shoot
    and the threads, yellow, yellow--
    sheer till they burnt
    to red-purple in the cup.

    As I pass your cell-door
    do not speak.
    I was first on the list--
    They may forget you tried to shield me
    as the horsemen passed.




STORM


    You crash over the trees,
    you crack the live branch--
    the branch is white,
    the green crushed,
    each leaf is rent like split wood.

    You burden the trees
    with black drops,
    you swirl and crash--
    you have broken off a weighted leaf
    in the wind,
    it is hurled out,
    whirls up and sinks,
    a green stone.




SEA IRIS


    I

    Weed, moss-weed,
    root tangled in sand,
    sea-iris, brittle flower,
    one petal like a shell
    is broken,
    and you print a shadow
    like a thin twig.

    Fortunate one,
    scented and stinging,
    rigid myrrh-bud,
    camphor-flower,
    sweet and salt--you are wind
    in our nostrils.


    II

    Do the murex-fishers
    drench you as they pass?
    Do your roots drag up colour
    from the sand?
    Have they slipped gold under you--
    rivets of gold?

    Band of iris-flowers
    above the waves,
    you are painted blue,
    painted like a fresh prow
    stained among the salt weeds.




HERMES OF THE WAYS


    The hard sand breaks,
    and the grains of it
    are clear as wine.

    Far off over the leagues of it,
    the wind,
    playing on the wide shore,
    piles little ridges,
    and the great waves
    break over it.

    But more than the many-foamed ways
    of the sea,
    I know him
    of the triple path-ways,
    Hermes,
    who awaits.

    Dubious,
    facing three ways,
    welcoming wayfarers,
    he whom the sea-orchard
    shelters from the west,
    from the east
    weathers sea-wind;
    fronts the great dunes.

    Wind rushes
    over the dunes,
    and the coarse, salt-crusted grass
    answers.

    Heu,
    it whips round my ankles!


    II

    Small is
    this white stream,
    flowing below ground
    from the poplar-shaded hill,
    but the water is sweet.

    Apples on the small trees
    are hard,
    too small,
    too late ripened
    by a desperate sun
    that struggles through sea-mist.

    The boughs of the trees
    are twisted
    by many bafflings;
    twisted are
    the small-leafed boughs.

    But the shadow of them
    is not the shadow of the mast head
    nor of the torn sails.

    Hermes, Hermes,
    the great sea foamed,
    gnashed its teeth about me;
    but you have waited,
    were sea-grass tangles with
    shore-grass.




PEAR TREE


    Silver dust
    lifted from the earth,
    higher than my arms reach,
    you have mounted,
    O silver,
    higher than my arms reach
    you front us with great mass;

    no flower ever opened
    so staunch a white leaf,
    no flower ever parted silver
    from such rare silver;

    O white pear,
    your flower-tufts
    thick on the branch
    bring summer and ripe fruits
    in their purple hearts.




CITIES


    Can we believe--by an effort
    comfort our hearts:
    it is not waste all this,
    not placed here in disgust,
    street after street,
    each patterned alike,
    no grace to lighten
    a single house of the hundred
    crowded into one garden-space.

    Crowded--can we believe,
    not in utter disgust,
    in ironical play--
    but the maker of cities grew faint
    with the beauty of temple
    and space before temple,
    arch upon perfect arch,
    of pillars and corridors that led out
    to strange court-yards and porches
    where sun-light stamped
    hyacinth-shadows
    black on the pavement.

    That the maker of cities grew faint
    with the splendour of palaces,
    paused while the incense-flowers
    from the incense-trees
    dropped on the marble-walk,
    thought anew, fashioned this--
    street after street alike.

    For alas,
    he had crowded the city so full
    that men could not grasp beauty,
    beauty was over them,
    through them, about them,
    no crevice unpacked with the honey,
    rare, measureless.

    So he built a new city,
    ah can we believe, not ironically
    but for new splendour
    constructed new people
    to lift through slow growth
    to a beauty unrivalled yet--
    and created new cells,
    hideous first, hideous now--
    spread larve across them,
    not honey but seething life.

    And in these dark cells,
    packed street after street,
    souls live, hideous yet--
    O disfigured, defaced,
    with no trace of the beauty
    men once held so light.

    Can we think a few old cells
    were left--we are left--
    grains of honey,
    old dust of stray pollen
    dull on our torn wings,
    we are left to recall the old streets?

    Is our task the less sweet
    that the larve still sleep in their cells?
    Or crawl out to attack our frail strength:
    You are useless. We live.
    We await great events.
    We are spread through this earth.
    We protect our strong race.
    You are useless.
    Your cell takes the place
    of our young future strength.

    Though they sleep or wake to torment
    and wish to displace our old cells--
    thin rare gold--
    that their larve grow fat--
    is our task the less sweet?

    Though we wander about,
    find no honey of flowers in this waste,
    is our task the less sweet--
    who recall the old splendour,
    await the new beauty of cities?




    _The city is peopled
    with spirits, not ghosts, O my love:_

    _Though they crowded between
    and usurped the kiss of my mouth
    their breath was your gift,
    their beauty, your life._





    This is my letter to the world,
       That never wrote to me, --
    The simple news that Nature told,
       With tender majesty.

    Her message is committed
       To hands I cannot see;
    For love of her, sweet countrymen,
       Judge tenderly of me!










I. LIFE.


I.

SUCCESS.

Success is counted sweetest
By those who ne'er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need.

Not one of all the purple host
Who took the flag to-day
Can tell the definition,
So clear, of victory,

As he, defeated, dying,
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Break, agonized and clear!





II.

Our share of night to bear,
Our share of morning,
Our blank in bliss to fill,
Our blank in scorning.

Here a star, and there a star,
Some lose their way.
Here a mist, and there a mist,
Afterwards -- day!





III.

ROUGE ET NOIR.

Soul, wilt thou toss again?
By just such a hazard
Hundreds have lost, indeed,
But tens have won an all.

Angels' breathless ballot
Lingers to record thee;
Imps in eager caucus
Raffle for my soul.





IV.

ROUGE GAGNE.

'T is so much joy! 'T is so much joy!
If I should fail, what poverty!
And yet, as poor as I
Have ventured all upon a throw;
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so
This side the victory!

Life is but life, and death but death!
Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!
And if, indeed, I fail,
At least to know the worst is sweet.
Defeat means nothing but defeat,
No drearier can prevail!

And if I gain, -- oh, gun at sea,
Oh, bells that in the steeples be,
At first repeat it slow!
For heaven is a different thing
Conjectured, and waked sudden in,
And might o'erwhelm me so!





V.

Glee! The great storm is over!
Four have recovered the land;
Forty gone down together
Into the boiling sand.

Ring, for the scant salvation!
Toll, for the bonnie souls, --
Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,
Spinning upon the shoals!

How they will tell the shipwreck
When winter shakes the door,
Till the children ask, "But the forty?
Did they come back no more?"

Then a silence suffuses the story,
And a softness the teller's eye;
And the children no further question,
And only the waves reply.





VI.

If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one life the aching,
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again,
I shall not live in vain.





VII.

ALMOST!

Within my reach!
I could have touched!
I might have chanced that way!
Soft sauntered through the village,
Sauntered as soft away!
So unsuspected violets
Within the fields lie low,
Too late for striving fingers
That passed, an hour ago.





VIII.

A wounded deer leaps highest,
I've heard the hunter tell;
'T is but the ecstasy of death,
And then the brake is still.

The smitten rock that gushes,
The trampled steel that springs;
A cheek is always redder
Just where the hectic stings!

Mirth is the mail of anguish,
In which it cautions arm,
Lest anybody spy the blood
And "You're hurt" exclaim!





IX.

The heart asks pleasure first,
And then, excuse from pain;
And then, those little anodynes
That deaden suffering;

And then, to go to sleep;
And then, if it should be
The will of its Inquisitor,
The liberty to die.





X.

IN A LIBRARY.

A precious, mouldering pleasure 't is
To meet an antique book,
In just the dress his century wore;
A privilege, I think,

His venerable hand to take,
And warming in our own,
A passage back, or two, to make
To times when he was young.

His quaint opinions to inspect,
His knowledge to unfold
On what concerns our mutual mind,
The literature of old;

What interested scholars most,
What competitions ran
When Plato was a certainty.
And Sophocles a man;

When Sappho was a living girl,
And Beatrice wore
The gown that Dante deified.
Facts, centuries before,

He traverses familiar,
As one should come to town
And tell you all your dreams were true;
He lived where dreams were sown.

His presence is enchantment,
You beg him not to go;
Old volumes shake their vellum heads
And tantalize, just so.





XI.

Much madness is divinest sense
To a discerning eye;
Much sense the starkest madness.
'T is the majority
In this, as all, prevails.
Assent, and you are sane;
Demur, -- you're straightway dangerous,
And handled with a chain.
XII.

I asked no other thing,
No other was denied.
I offered Being for it;
The mighty merchant smiled.

Brazil? He twirled a button,
Without a glance my way:
"But, madam, is there nothing else
That we can show to-day?"





XIII.

EXCLUSION.

The soul selects her own society,
Then shuts the door;
On her divine majority
Obtrude no more.

Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
At her low gate;
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
Upon her mat.

I've known her from an ample nation
Choose one;
Then close the valves of her attention
Like stone.





XIV.

THE SECRET.

Some things that fly there be, --
Birds, hours, the bumble-bee:
Of these no elegy.

Some things that stay there be, --
Grief, hills, eternity:
Nor this behooveth me.

There are, that resting, rise.
Can I expound the skies?
How still the riddle lies!





XV.

THE LONELY HOUSE.

I know some lonely houses off the road
A robber 'd like the look of, --
Wooden barred,
And windows hanging low,
Inviting to
A portico,
Where two could creep:
One hand the tools,
The other peep
To make sure all's asleep.
Old-fashioned eyes,
Not easy to surprise!

How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night,
With just a clock, --
But they could gag the tick,
And mice won't bark;
And so the walls don't tell,
None will.

A pair of spectacles ajar just stir --
An almanac's aware.
Was it the mat winked,
Or a nervous star?
The moon slides down the stair
To see who's there.

There's plunder, -- where?
Tankard, or spoon,
Earring, or stone,
A watch, some ancient brooch
To match the grandmamma,
Staid sleeping there.

Day rattles, too,
Stealth's slow;
The sun has got as far
As the third sycamore.
Screams chanticleer,
"Who's there?"
And echoes, trains away,
Sneer -- "Where?"
While the old couple, just astir,
Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!





XVI.

To fight aloud is very brave,
But gallanter, I know,
Who charge within the bosom,
The cavalry of woe.

Who win, and nations do not see,
Who fall, and none observe,
Whose dying eyes no country
Regards with patriot love.

We trust, in plumed procession,
For such the angels go,
Rank after rank, with even feet
And uniforms of snow.





XVII.

DAWN.

When night is almost done,
And sunrise grows so near
That we can touch the spaces,
It 's time to smooth the hair

And get the dimples ready,
And wonder we could care
For that old faded midnight
That frightened but an hour.





XVIII.

THE BOOK OF MARTYRS.

Read, sweet, how others strove,
Till we are stouter;
What they renounced,
Till we are less afraid;
How many times they bore
The faithful witness,
Till we are helped,
As if a kingdom cared!

Read then of faith
That shone above the fagot;
Clear strains of hymn
The river could not drown;
Brave names of men
And celestial women,
Passed out of record
Into renown!





XIX.

THE MYSTERY OF PAIN.

Pain has an element of blank;
It cannot recollect
When it began, or if there were
A day when it was not.

It has no future but itself,
Its infinite realms contain
Its past, enlightened to perceive
New periods of pain.





XX.

I taste a liquor never brewed,
From tankards scooped in pearl;
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
Yield such an alcohol!

Inebriate of air am I,
And debauchee of dew,
Reeling, through endless summer days,
From inns of molten blue.

When landlords turn the drunken bee
Out of the foxglove's door,
When butterflies renounce their drams,
I shall but drink the more!

Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,
And saints to windows run,
To see the little tippler
Leaning against the sun!





XXI.

A BOOK.

He ate and drank the precious words,
His spirit grew robust;
He knew no more that he was poor,
Nor that his frame was dust.
He danced along the dingy days,
And this bequest of wings
Was but a book. What liberty
A loosened spirit brings!





XXII.

I had no time to hate, because
The grave would hinder me,
And life was not so ample I
Could finish enmity.

Nor had I time to love; but since
Some industry must be,
The little toil of love, I thought,
Was large enough for me.





XXIII.

UNRETURNING.

'T was such a little, little boat
That toddled down the bay!
'T was such a gallant, gallant sea
That beckoned it away!

'T was such a greedy, greedy wave
That licked it from the coast;
Nor ever guessed the stately sails
My little craft was lost!





XXIV.

Whether my bark went down at sea,
Whether she met with gales,
Whether to isles enchanted
She bent her docile sails;

By what mystic mooring
She is held to-day, --
This is the errand of the eye
Out upon the bay.





XXV.

Belshazzar had a letter, --
He never had but one;
Belshazzar's correspondent
Concluded and begun
In that immortal copy
The conscience of us all
Can read without its glasses
On revelation's wall.





XXVI.

The brain within its groove
Runs evenly and true;
But let a splinter swerve,
'T were easier for you
To put the water back
When floods have slit the hills,
And scooped a turnpike for themselves,
And blotted out the mills!






II. LOVE.


I.

MINE.

Mine by the right of the white election!
Mine by the royal seal!
Mine by the sign in the scarlet prison
Bars cannot conceal!

Mine, here in vision and in veto!
Mine, by the grave's repeal
Titled, confirmed, -- delirious charter!
Mine, while the ages steal!





II.

BEQUEST.

You left me, sweet, two legacies, --
A legacy of love
A Heavenly Father would content,
Had He the offer of;

You left me boundaries of pain
Capacious as the sea,
Between eternity and time,
Your consciousness and me.





III.

Alter? When the hills do.
Falter? When the sun
Question if his glory
Be the perfect one.

Surfeit? When the daffodil
Doth of the dew:
Even as herself, O friend!
I will of you!





IV.

SUSPENSE.

Elysium is as far as to
The very nearest room,
If in that room a friend await
Felicity or doom.

What fortitude the soul contains,
That it can so endure
The accent of a coming foot,
The opening of a door!





V.

SURRENDER.

Doubt me, my dim companion!
Why, God would be content
With but a fraction of the love
Poured thee without a stint.
The whole of me, forever,
What more the woman can, --
Say quick, that I may dower thee
With last delight I own!

It cannot be my spirit,
For that was thine before;
I ceded all of dust I knew, --
What opulence the more
Had I, a humble maiden,
Whose farthest of degree
Was that she might,
Some distant heaven,
Dwell timidly with thee!





VI.

If you were coming in the fall,
I'd brush the summer by
With half a smile and half a spurn,
As housewives do a fly.

If I could see you in a year,
I'd wind the months in balls,
And put them each in separate drawers,
Until their time befalls.

If only centuries delayed,
I'd count them on my hand,
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Into Van Diemen's land.

If certain, when this life was out,
That yours and mine should be,
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,
And taste eternity.

But now, all ignorant of the length
Of time's uncertain wing,
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
That will not state its sting.





VII.

WITH A FLOWER.

I hide myself within my flower,
That wearing on your breast,
You, unsuspecting, wear me too --
And angels know the rest.

I hide myself within my flower,
That, fading from your vase,
You, unsuspecting, feel for me
Almost a loneliness.





VIII.

PROOF.

That I did always love,
I bring thee proof:
That till I loved
I did not love enough.

That I shall love alway,
I offer thee
That love is life,
And life hath immortality.

This, dost thou doubt, sweet?
Then have I
Nothing to show
But Calvary.





IX.

Have you got a brook in your little heart,
Where bashful flowers blow,
And blushing birds go down to drink,
And shadows tremble so?

And nobody knows, so still it flows,
That any brook is there;
And yet your little draught of life
Is daily drunken there.

Then look out for the little brook in March,
When the rivers overflow,
And the snows come hurrying from the hills,
And the bridges often go.

And later, in August it may be,
When the meadows parching lie,
Beware, lest this little brook of life
Some burning noon go dry!





X.

TRANSPLANTED.

As if some little Arctic flower,
Upon the polar hem,
Went wandering down the latitudes,
Until it puzzled came
To continents of summer,
To firmaments of sun,
To strange, bright crowds of flowers,
And birds of foreign tongue!
I say, as if this little flower
To Eden wandered in --
What then? Why, nothing, only,
Your inference therefrom!





XI.

THE OUTLET.

My river runs to thee:
Blue sea, wilt welcome me?

My river waits reply.
Oh sea, look graciously!

I'll fetch thee brooks
From spotted nooks, --

Say, sea,
Take me!





XII.

IN VAIN.

I cannot live with you,
It would be life,
And life is over there
Behind the shelf

The sexton keeps the key to,
Putting up
Our life, his porcelain,
Like a cup

Discarded of the housewife,
Quaint or broken;
A newer Sevres pleases,
Old ones crack.

I could not die with you,
For one must wait
To shut the other's gaze down, --
You could not.

And I, could I stand by
And see you freeze,
Without my right of frost,
Death's privilege?

Nor could I rise with you,
Because your face
Would put out Jesus',
That new grace

Glow plain and foreign
On my homesick eye,
Except that you, than he
Shone closer by.

They'd judge us -- how?
For you served Heaven, you know,
Or sought to;
I could not,

Because you saturated sight,
And I had no more eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise.

And were you lost, I would be,
Though my name
Rang loudest
On the heavenly fame.

And were you saved,
And I condemned to be
Where you were not,
That self were hell to me.

So we must keep apart,
You there, I here,
With just the door ajar
That oceans are,
And prayer,
And that pale sustenance,
Despair!





XIII.

RENUNCIATION.

There came a day at summer's full
Entirely for me;
I thought that such were for the saints,
Where revelations be.

The sun, as common, went abroad,
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
As if no soul the solstice passed
That maketh all things new.

The time was scarce profaned by speech;
The symbol of a word
Was needless, as at sacrament
The wardrobe of our Lord.

Each was to each the sealed church,
Permitted to commune this time,
Lest we too awkward show
At supper of the Lamb.

The hours slid fast, as hours will,
Clutched tight by greedy hands;
So faces on two decks look back,
Bound to opposing lands.

And so, when all the time had failed,
Without external sound,
Each bound the other's crucifix,
We gave no other bond.

Sufficient troth that we shall rise --
Deposed, at length, the grave --
To that new marriage, justified
Through Calvaries of Love!





XIV.

LOVE'S BAPTISM.

I'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs;
The name they dropped upon my face
With water, in the country church,
Is finished using now,
And they can put it with my dolls,
My childhood, and the string of spools
I've finished threading too.

Baptized before without the choice,
But this time consciously, of grace
Unto supremest name,
Called to my full, the crescent dropped,
Existence's whole arc filled up
With one small diadem.

My second rank, too small the first,
Crowned, crowing on my father's breast,
A half unconscious queen;
But this time, adequate, erect,
With will to choose or to reject.
And I choose -- just a throne.





XV.

RESURRECTION.

'T was a long parting, but the time
For interview had come;
Before the judgment-seat of God,
The last and second time

These fleshless lovers met,
A heaven in a gaze,
A heaven of heavens, the privilege
Of one another's eyes.

No lifetime set on them,
Apparelled as the new
Unborn, except they had beheld,
Born everlasting now.

Was bridal e'er like this?
A paradise, the host,
And cherubim and seraphim
The most familiar guest.





XVI.

APOCALYPSE.

I'm wife; I've finished that,
That other state;
I'm Czar, I'm woman now:
It's safer so.

How odd the girl's life looks
Behind this soft eclipse!
I think that earth seems so
To those in heaven now.

This being comfort, then
That other kind was pain;
But why compare?
I'm wife! stop there!





XVII.

THE WIFE.

She rose to his requirement, dropped
The playthings of her life
To take the honorable work
Of woman and of wife.

If aught she missed in her new day
Of amplitude, or awe,
Or first prospective, or the gold
In using wore away,

It lay unmentioned, as the sea
Develops pearl and weed,
But only to himself is known
The fathoms they abide.





XVIII.

APOTHEOSIS.

Come slowly, Eden!
Lips unused to thee,
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,

Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars -- enters,
And is lost in balms!











III. NATURE.

I.

New feet within my garden go,
New fingers stir the sod;
A troubadour upon the elm
Betrays the solitude.

New children play upon the green,
New weary sleep below;
And still the pensive spring returns,
And still the punctual snow!





II.

MAY-FLOWER.

Pink, small, and punctual,
Aromatic, low,
Covert in April,
Candid in May,

Dear to the moss,
Known by the knoll,
Next to the robin
In every human soul.

Bold little beauty,
Bedecked with thee,
Nature forswears
Antiquity.





III.

WHY?

The murmur of a bee
A witchcraft yieldeth me.
If any ask me why,
'T were easier to die
Than tell.

The red upon the hill
Taketh away my will;
If anybody sneer,
Take care, for God is here,
That's all.

The breaking of the day
Addeth to my degree;
If any ask me how,
Artist, who drew me so,
Must tell!





IV.

Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower?
But I could never sell.
If you would like to borrow
Until the daffodil

Unties her yellow bonnet
Beneath the village door,
Until the bees, from clover rows
Their hock and sherry draw,

Why, I will lend until just then,
But not an hour more!





V.

The pedigree of honey
Does not concern the bee;
A clover, any time, to him
Is aristocracy.





VI.

A SERVICE OF SONG.

Some keep the Sabbath going to church;
I keep it staying at home,
With a bobolink for a chorister,
And an orchard for a dome.

Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;
I just wear my wings,
And instead of tolling the bell for church,
Our little sexton sings.

God preaches, -- a noted clergyman, --
And the sermon is never long;
So instead of getting to heaven at last,
I'm going all along!





VII.

The bee is not afraid of me,
I know the butterfly;
The pretty people in the woods
Receive me cordially.

The brooks laugh louder when I come,
The breezes madder play.
Wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?
Wherefore, O summer's day?





VIII.

SUMMER'S ARMIES.

Some rainbow coming from the fair!
Some vision of the world Cashmere
I confidently see!
Or else a peacock's purple train,
Feather by feather, on the plain
Fritters itself away!

The dreamy butterflies bestir,
Lethargic pools resume the whir
Of last year's sundered tune.
From some old fortress on the sun
Baronial bees march, one by one,
In murmuring platoon!

The robins stand as thick to-day
As flakes of snow stood yesterday,
On fence and roof and twig.
The orchis binds her feather on
For her old lover, Don the Sun,
Revisiting the bog!

Without commander, countless, still,
The regiment of wood and hill
In bright detachment stand.
Behold! Whose multitudes are these?
The children of whose turbaned seas,
Or what Circassian land?





IX.

THE GRASS.

The grass so little has to do, --
A sphere of simple green,
With only butterflies to brood,
And bees to entertain,

And stir all day to pretty tunes
The breezes fetch along,
And hold the sunshine in its lap
And bow to everything;

And thread the dews all night, like pearls,
And make itself so fine, --
A duchess were too common
For such a noticing.

And even when it dies, to pass
In odors so divine,
As lowly spices gone to sleep,
Or amulets of pine.

And then to dwell in sovereign barns,
And dream the days away, --
The grass so little has to do,
I wish I were the hay!





X.

A little road not made of man,
Enabled of the eye,
Accessible to thill of bee,
Or cart of butterfly.

If town it have, beyond itself,
'T is that I cannot say;
I only sigh, -- no vehicle
Bears me along that way.





XI.

SUMMER SHOWER.

A drop fell on the apple tree,
Another on the roof;
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
And made the gables laugh.

A few went out to help the brook,
That went to help the sea.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
What necklaces could be!

The dust replaced in hoisted roads,
The birds jocoser sung;
The sunshine threw his hat away,
The orchards spangles hung.

The breezes brought dejected lutes,
And bathed them in the glee;
The East put out a single flag,
And signed the fete away.





XII.

PSALM OF THE DAY.

A something in a summer's day,
As slow her flambeaux burn away,
Which solemnizes me.

A something in a summer's noon, --
An azure depth, a wordless tune,
Transcending ecstasy.

And still within a summer's night
A something so transporting bright,
I clap my hands to see;

Then veil my too inspecting face,
Lest such a subtle, shimmering grace
Flutter too far for me.

The wizard-fingers never rest,
The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes its narrow bed;

Still rears the East her amber flag,
Guides still the sun along the crag
His caravan of red,

Like flowers that heard the tale of dews,
But never deemed the dripping prize
Awaited their low brows;

Or bees, that thought the summer's name
Some rumor of delirium
No summer could for them;

Or Arctic creature, dimly stirred
By tropic hint, -- some travelled bird
Imported to the wood;

Or wind's bright signal to the ear,
Making that homely and severe,
Contented, known, before

The heaven unexpected came,
To lives that thought their worshipping
A too presumptuous psalm.





XIII.

THE SEA OF SUNSET.

This is the land the sunset washes,
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;
Where it rose, or whither it rushes,
These are the western mystery!

Night after night her purple traffic
Strews the landing with opal bales;
Merchantmen poise upon horizons,
Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.





XIV.

PURPLE CLOVER.

There is a flower that bees prefer,
And butterflies desire;
To gain the purple democrat
The humming-birds aspire.

And whatsoever insect pass,
A honey bears away
Proportioned to his several dearth
And her capacity.

Her face is rounder than the moon,
And ruddier than the gown
Of orchis in the pasture,
Or rhododendron worn.

She doth not wait for June;
Before the world is green
Her sturdy little countenance
Against the wind is seen,

Contending with the grass,
Near kinsman to herself,
For privilege of sod and sun,
Sweet litigants for life.

And when the hills are full,
And newer fashions blow,
Doth not retract a single spice
For pang of jealousy.

Her public is the noon,
Her providence the sun,
Her progress by the bee proclaimed
In sovereign, swerveless tune.

The bravest of the host,
Surrendering the last,
Nor even of defeat aware
When cancelled by the frost.





XV.

THE BEE.

Like trains of cars on tracks of plush
I hear the level bee:
A jar across the flowers goes,
Their velvet masonry

Withstands until the sweet assault
Their chivalry consumes,
While he, victorious, tilts away
To vanquish other blooms.

His feet are shod with gauze,
His helmet is of gold;
His breast, a single onyx
With chrysoprase, inlaid.

His labor is a chant,
His idleness a tune;
Oh, for a bee's experience
Of clovers and of noon!





XVI.

Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
Indicative that suns go down;
The notice to the startled grass
That darkness is about to pass.





XVII.

As children bid the guest good-night,
And then reluctant turn,
My flowers raise their pretty lips,
Then put their nightgowns on.

As children caper when they wake,
Merry that it is morn,
My flowers from a hundred cribs
Will peep, and prance again.





XVIII.

Angels in the early morning
May be seen the dews among,
Stooping, plucking, smiling, flying:
Do the buds to them belong?

Angels when the sun is hottest
May be seen the sands among,
Stooping, plucking, sighing, flying;
Parched the flowers they bear along.





XIX.

So bashful when I spied her,
So pretty, so ashamed!
So hidden in her leaflets,
Lest anybody find;

So breathless till I passed her,
So helpless when I turned
And bore her, struggling, blushing,
Her simple haunts beyond!

For whom I robbed the dingle,
For whom betrayed the dell,
Many will doubtless ask me,
But I shall never tell!





XX.

TWO WORLDS.

It makes no difference abroad,
The seasons fit the same,
The mornings blossom into noons,
And split their pods of flame.

Wild-flowers kindle in the woods,
The brooks brag all the day;
No blackbird bates his jargoning
For passing Calvary.

Auto-da-fe and judgment
Are nothing to the bee;
His separation from his rose
To him seems misery.





XXI.

THE MOUNTAIN.

The mountain sat upon the plain
In his eternal chair,
His observation omnifold,
His inquest everywhere.

The seasons prayed around his knees,
Like children round a sire:
Grandfather of the days is he,
Of dawn the ancestor.





XXII.

A DAY.

I'll tell you how the sun rose, --
A ribbon at a time.
The steeples swam in amethyst,
The news like squirrels ran.

The hills untied their bonnets,
The bobolinks begun.
Then I said softly to myself,
"That must have been the sun!"

        *  *  *

But how he set, I know not.
There seemed a purple stile
Which little yellow boys and girls
Were climbing all the while

Till when they reached the other side,
A dominie in gray
Put gently up the evening bars,
And led the flock away.





XXIII.

The butterfly's assumption-gown,
In chrysoprase apartments hung,
  This afternoon put on.

How condescending to descend,
And be of buttercups the friend
  In a New England town!





XXIV.

THE WIND.

Of all the sounds despatched abroad,
There's not a charge to me
Like that old measure in the boughs,
That phraseless melody

The wind does, working like a hand
Whose fingers brush the sky,
Then quiver down, with tufts of tune
Permitted gods and me.

When winds go round and round in bands,
And thrum upon the door,
And birds take places overhead,
To bear them orchestra,

I crave him grace, of summer boughs,
If such an outcast be,
He never heard that fleshless chant
Rise solemn in the tree,

As if some caravan of sound
On deserts, in the sky,
Had broken rank,
Then knit, and passed
In seamless company.





XXV.

DEATH AND LIFE.

Apparently with no surprise
To any happy flower,
The frost beheads it at its play
In accidental power.
The blond assassin passes on,
The sun proceeds unmoved
To measure off another day
For an approving God.





XXVI.

'T WAS later when the summer went
Than when the cricket came,
And yet we knew that gentle clock
Meant nought but going home.

'T was sooner when the cricket went
Than when the winter came,
Yet that pathetic pendulum
Keeps esoteric time.





XXVII.

INDIAN SUMMER.

These are the days when birds come back,
A very few, a bird or two,
To take a backward look.

These are the days when skies put on
The old, old sophistries of June, --
A blue and gold mistake.

Oh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,
Almost thy plausibility
Induces my belief,

Till ranks of seeds their witness bear,
And softly through the altered air
Hurries a timid leaf!

Oh, sacrament of summer days,
Oh, last communion in the haze,
Permit a child to join,

Thy sacred emblems to partake,
Thy consecrated bread to break,
Taste thine immortal wine!





XXVIII.

AUTUMN.

The morns are meeker than they were,
The nuts are getting brown;
The berry's cheek is plumper,
The rose is out of town.

The maple wears a gayer scarf,
The field a scarlet gown.
Lest I should be old-fashioned,
I'll put a trinket on.





XXIX.

BECLOUDED.

The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
A travelling flake of snow
Across a barn or through a rut
Debates if it will go.

A narrow wind complains all day
How some one treated him;
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
Without her diadem.





XXX.

THE HEMLOCK.

I think the hemlock likes to stand
Upon a marge of snow;
It suits his own austerity,
And satisfies an awe

That men must slake in wilderness,
Or in the desert cloy, --
An instinct for the hoar, the bald,
Lapland's necessity.

The hemlock's nature thrives on cold;
The gnash of northern winds
Is sweetest nutriment to him,
His best Norwegian wines.

To satin races he is nought;
But children on the Don
Beneath his tabernacles play,
And Dnieper wrestlers run.





XXXI.

There's a certain slant of light,
On winter afternoons,
That oppresses, like the weight
Of cathedral tunes.

Heavenly hurt it gives us;
We can find no scar,
But internal difference
Where the meanings are.

None may teach it anything,
' T is the seal, despair, --
An imperial affliction
Sent us of the air.

When it comes, the landscape listens,
Shadows hold their breath;
When it goes, 't is like the distance
On the look of death.






IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.

I.

One dignity delays for all,
One mitred afternoon.
None can avoid this purple,
None evade this crown.

Coach it insures, and footmen,
Chamber and state and throng;
Bells, also, in the village,
As we ride grand along.

What dignified attendants,
What service when we pause!
How loyally at parting
Their hundred hats they raise!

How pomp surpassing ermine,
When simple you and I
Present our meek escutcheon,
And claim the rank to die!





II.

TOO LATE.

Delayed till she had ceased to know,
Delayed till in its vest of snow
   Her loving bosom lay.
An hour behind the fleeting breath,
Later by just an hour than death, --
   Oh, lagging yesterday!

Could she have guessed that it would be;
Could but a crier of the glee
   Have climbed the distant hill;
Had not the bliss so slow a pace, --
Who knows but this surrendered face
   Were undefeated still?

Oh, if there may departing be
Any forgot by victory
   In her imperial round,
Show them this meek apparelled thing,
That could not stop to be a king,
   Doubtful if it be crowned!





III.

ASTRA CASTRA.

Departed to the judgment,
A mighty afternoon;
Great clouds like ushers leaning,
Creation looking on.

The flesh surrendered, cancelled,
The bodiless begun;
Two worlds, like audiences, disperse
And leave the soul alone.





IV.

Safe in their alabaster chambers,
Untouched by morning and untouched by noon,
Sleep the meek members of the resurrection,
Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.

Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;
Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;
Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence, --
Ah, what sagacity perished here!

Grand go the years in the crescent above them;
Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,
Diadems drop and Doges surrender,
Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.





V.

On this long storm the rainbow rose,
On this late morn the sun;
The clouds, like listless elephants,
Horizons straggled down.

The birds rose smiling in their nests,
The gales indeed were done;
Alas! how heedless were the eyes
On whom the summer shone!

The quiet nonchalance of death
No daybreak can bestir;
The slow archangel's syllables
Must awaken her.





VI.

FROM THE CHRYSALIS.

My cocoon tightens, colors tease,
I'm feeling for the air;
A dim capacity for wings
Degrades the dress I wear.

A power of butterfly must be
The aptitude to fly,
Meadows of majesty concedes
And easy sweeps of sky.

So I must baffle at the hint
And cipher at the sign,
And make much blunder, if at last
I take the clew divine.





VII.

SETTING SAIL.

Exultation is the going
Of an inland soul to sea, --
Past the houses, past the headlands,
Into deep eternity!

Bred as we, among the mountains,
Can the sailor understand
The divine intoxication
Of the first league out from land?





VIII.

Look back on time with kindly eyes,
He doubtless did his best;
How softly sinks his trembling sun
In human nature's west!





IX.

A train went through a burial gate,
A bird broke forth and sang,
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat
Till all the churchyard rang;

And then adjusted his little notes,
And bowed and sang again.
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him
To say good-by to men.





X.

I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.

He questioned softly why I failed?
"For beauty," I replied.
"And I for truth, -- the two are one;
We brethren are," he said.

And so, as kinsmen met a night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.





XI.

"TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS."

How many times these low feet staggered,
Only the soldered mouth can tell;
Try! can you stir the awful rivet?
Try! can you lift the hasps of steel?

Stroke the cool forehead, hot so often,
Lift, if you can, the listless hair;
Handle the adamantine fingers
Never a thimble more shall wear.

Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window;
Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane;
Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling --
Indolent housewife, in daisies lain!





XII.

REAL.

I like a look of agony,
Because I know it 's true;
Men do not sham convulsion,
Nor simulate a throe.

The eyes glaze once, and that is death.
Impossible to feign
The beads upon the forehead
By homely anguish strung.





XIII.

THE FUNERAL.

That short, potential stir
That each can make but once,
That bustle so illustrious
'T is almost consequence,

Is the eclat of death.
Oh, thou unknown renown
That not a beggar would accept,
Had he the power to spurn!





XIV.

I went to thank her,
But she slept;
Her bed a funnelled stone,
With nosegays at the head and foot,
That travellers had thrown,

Who went to thank her;
But she slept.
'T was short to cross the sea
To look upon her like, alive,
But turning back 't was slow.





XV.

I've seen a dying eye
Run round and round a room
In search of something, as it seemed,
Then cloudier become;
And then, obscure with fog,
And then be soldered down,
Without disclosing what it be,
'T were blessed to have seen.





XVI.

REFUGE.

The clouds their backs together laid,
The north begun to push,
The forests galloped till they fell,
The lightning skipped like mice;
The thunder crumbled like a stuff --
How good to be safe in tombs,
Where nature's temper cannot reach,
Nor vengeance ever comes!





XVII.

I never saw a moor,
I never saw the sea;
Yet know I how the heather looks,
And what a wave must be.

I never spoke with God,
Nor visited in heaven;
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the chart were given.





XVIII.

PLAYMATES.

God permits industrious angels
Afternoons to play.
I met one, -- forgot my school-mates,
All, for him, straightway.

God calls home the angels promptly
At the setting sun;
I missed mine. How dreary marbles,
After playing Crown!





XIX.

To know just how he suffered would be dear;
To know if any human eyes were near
To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,
Until it settled firm on Paradise.

To know if he was patient, part content,
Was dying as he thought, or different;
Was it a pleasant day to die,
And did the sunshine face his way?

What was his furthest mind, of home, or God,
Or what the distant say
At news that he ceased human nature
On such a day?

And wishes, had he any?
Just his sigh, accented,
Had been legible to me.
And was he confident until
Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?

And if he spoke, what name was best,
What first,
What one broke off with
At the drowsiest?

Was he afraid, or tranquil?
Might he know
How conscious consciousness could grow,
Till love that was, and love too blest to be,
Meet -- and the junction be Eternity?





XX.

The last night that she lived,
It was a common night,
Except the dying; this to us
Made nature different.

We noticed smallest things, --
Things overlooked before,
By this great light upon our minds
Italicized, as 't were.

That others could exist
While she must finish quite,
A jealousy for her arose
So nearly infinite.

We waited while she passed;
It was a narrow time,
Too jostled were our souls to speak,
At length the notice came.

She mentioned, and forgot;
Then lightly as a reed
Bent to the water, shivered scarce,
Consented, and was dead.

And we, we placed the hair,
And drew the head erect;
And then an awful leisure was,
Our faith to regulate.





XXI.

THE FIRST LESSON.

Not in this world to see his face
Sounds long, until I read the place
Where this is said to be
But just the primer to a life
Unopened, rare, upon the shelf,
Clasped yet to him and me.

And yet, my primer suits me so
I would not choose a book to know
Than that, be sweeter wise;
Might some one else so learned be,
And leave me just my A B C,
Himself could have the skies.





XXII.

The bustle in a house
The morning after death
Is solemnest of industries
Enacted upon earth, --

The sweeping up the heart,
And putting love away
We shall not want to use again
Until eternity.





XXIII.

I reason, earth is short,
And anguish absolute,
And many hurt;
But what of that?

I reason, we could die:
The best vitality
Cannot excel decay;
But what of that?

I reason that in heaven
Somehow, it will be even,
Some new equation given;
But what of that?





XXIV.

Afraid? Of whom am I afraid?
Not death; for who is he?
The porter of my father's lodge
As much abasheth me.

Of life? 'T were odd I fear a thing
That comprehendeth me
In one or more existences
At Deity's decree.

Of resurrection? Is the east
Afraid to trust the morn
With her fastidious forehead?
As soon impeach my crown!





XXV.

DYING.

The sun kept setting, setting still;
No hue of afternoon
Upon the village I perceived, --
From house to house 't was noon.

The dusk kept dropping, dropping still;
No dew upon the grass,
But only on my forehead stopped,
And wandered in my face.

My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,
My fingers were awake;
Yet why so little sound myself
Unto my seeming make?

How well I knew the light before!
I could not see it now.
'T is dying, I am doing; but
I'm not afraid to know.





XXVI.

Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
Until the morning sun,
When one turned smiling to the land.
O God, the other one!

The stray ships passing spied a face
Upon the waters borne,
With eyes in death still begging raised,
And hands beseeching thrown.





XXVII.

THE CHARIOT.

Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.

We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.

We passed the school where children played,
Their lessons scarcely done;
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.

We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground;
The roof was scarcely visible,
The cornice but a mound.

Since then 't is centuries; but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity.





XXVIII.

She went as quiet as the dew
From a familiar flower.
Not like the dew did she return
At the accustomed hour!

She dropt as softly as a star
From out my summer's eve;
Less skilful than Leverrier
It's sorer to believe!





XXIX.

RESURGAM.

At last to be identified!
At last, the lamps upon thy side,
The rest of life to see!
Past midnight, past the morning star!
Past sunrise! Ah! what leagues there are
Between our feet and day!





XXX.

Except to heaven, she is nought;
Except for angels, lone;
Except to some wide-wandering bee,
A flower superfluous blown;

Except for winds, provincial;
Except by butterflies,
Unnoticed as a single dew
That on the acre lies.

The smallest housewife in the grass,
Yet take her from the lawn,
And somebody has lost the face
That made existence home!





XXXI.

Death is a dialogue between
The spirit and the dust.
"Dissolve," says Death. The Spirit, "Sir,
I have another trust."

Death doubts it, argues from the ground.
The Spirit turns away,
Just laying off, for evidence,
An overcoat of clay.





XXXII.

It was too late for man,
But early yet for God;
Creation impotent to help,
But prayer remained our side.

How excellent the heaven,
When earth cannot be had;
How hospitable, then, the face
Of our old neighbor, God!





XXXIII.

ALONG THE POTOMAC.

When I was small, a woman died.
To-day her only boy
Went up from the Potomac,
His face all victory,

To look at her; how slowly
The seasons must have turned
Till bullets clipt an angle,
And he passed quickly round!

If pride shall be in Paradise
I never can decide;
Of their imperial conduct,
No person testified.

But proud in apparition,
That woman and her boy
Pass back and forth before my brain,
As ever in the sky.





XXXIV.

The daisy follows soft the sun,
And when his golden walk is done,
   Sits shyly at his feet.
He, waking, finds the flower near.
"Wherefore, marauder, art thou here?"
   "Because, sir, love is sweet!"

We are the flower, Thou the sun!
Forgive us, if as days decline,
   We nearer steal to Thee, --
Enamoured of the parting west,
The peace, the flight, the amethyst,
   Night's possibility!





XXXV.

EMANCIPATION.

No rack can torture me,
My soul's at liberty
Behind this mortal bone
There knits a bolder one

You cannot prick with saw,
Nor rend with scymitar.
Two bodies therefore be;
Bind one, and one will flee.

The eagle of his nest
No easier divest
And gain the sky,
Than mayest thou,

Except thyself may be
Thine enemy;
Captivity is consciousness,
So's liberty.





XXXVI.

LOST.

I lost a world the other day.
Has anybody found?
You'll know it by the row of stars
Around its forehead bound.

A rich man might not notice it;
Yet to my frugal eye
Of more esteem than ducats.
Oh, find it, sir, for me!





XXXVII.

If I shouldn't be alive
When the robins come,
Give the one in red cravat
A memorial crumb.

If I couldn't thank you,
Being just asleep,
You will know I'm trying
With my granite lip!





XXXVIII.

Sleep is supposed to be,
By souls of sanity,
The shutting of the eye.

Sleep is the station grand
Down which on either hand
The hosts of witness stand!

Morn is supposed to be,
By people of degree,
The breaking of the day.

Morning has not occurred!
That shall aurora be
East of eternity;

One with the banner gay,
One in the red array, --
That is the break of day.





XXXIX.

I shall know why, when time is over,
And I have ceased to wonder why;
Christ will explain each separate anguish
In the fair schoolroom of the sky.

He will tell me what Peter promised,
And I, for wonder at his woe,
I shall forget the drop of anguish
That scalds me now, that scalds me now.





XL.

I never lost as much but twice,
And that was in the sod;
Twice have I stood a beggar
Before the door of God!

Angels, twice descending,
Reimbursed my store.
Burglar, banker, father,
I am poor once more!






POEMS

by EMILY DICKINSON

Second Series




Edited by two of her friends

MABEL LOOMIS TODD and T.W. HIGGINSON




PREFACE

The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's
poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern
artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the
qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest
themes,--life and love and death. That "irresistible needle-touch,"
as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very
core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as
it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling
power.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to
form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.

Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending
occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of
her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend "H.H."
must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th
September, 1884, she wrote:--


MY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses
you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your "day and
generation" that you will not give them light.

If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive
you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee
and executor. Surely after you are what is called
"dead" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you
have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your
verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think
we have a right to withhold from the world a word or
a thought any more than a deed which might help a
single soul. . . .

                Truly yours,

                        HELEN JACKSON.


The "portfolios" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death,
by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had
been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little
fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear
evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had
received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of
rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and
phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one
form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without
important exception, her friends have generously placed at the
disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and
these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several
renderings of the same verse.

To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been
subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They
should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and
suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some
time in the finished picture.

Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the
winter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the
April following, she says, "I made no verse, but one or two, until
this winter."

The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running
Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in
breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her
latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its
fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,
everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous
dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of
a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and
strong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of
the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,
the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general
chronologic accuracy.

As a rule, the verses were without titles; but "A Country Burial,"
"A Thunder-Storm," "The Humming-Bird," and a few others were named
by their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the
accompanying note, if sent to a friend.

The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in
pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of
responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not
absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her
rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it
seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and
more usual rhymes.

Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very
absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily
Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a
particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything
virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of
inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and
the "thought-rhyme" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an
unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.

Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.
Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the
sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She
touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost
humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is
never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic
has said, she may exhibit toward God "an Emersonian self-possession,"
it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced
as it is rare.

She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She
was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no
love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature
introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist
in pretence.

Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and
bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted
human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the
first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of
pope; the first red leaf hurrying through "the altered air," an
epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or
melancholy, she lived in its presence.

                                MABEL LOOMIS TODD.

        AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,
            August, I891.











    My nosegays are for captives;
       Dim, long-expectant eyes,
    Fingers denied the plucking,
       Patient till paradise,

    To such, if they should whisper
       Of morning and the moor,
    They bear no other errand,
       And I, no other prayer.




I. LIFE.


I.

I'm nobody!  Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there 's a pair of us -- don't tell!
They 'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!





II.

I bring an unaccustomed wine
To lips long parching, next to mine,
And summon them to drink.

Crackling with fever, they essay;
I turn my brimming eyes away,
And come next hour to look.

The hands still hug the tardy glass;
The lips I would have cooled, alas!
Are so superfluous cold,

I would as soon attempt to warm
The bosoms where the frost has lain
Ages beneath the mould.

Some other thirsty there may be
To whom this would have pointed me
Had it remained to speak.

And so I always bear the cup
If, haply, mine may be the drop
Some pilgrim thirst to slake, --

If, haply, any say to me,
"Unto the little, unto me,"
When I at last awake.





III.

The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
      The heaven we chase
      Like the June bee
      Before the school-boy
      Invites the race;
      Stoops to an easy clover --
Dips -- evades -- teases -- deploys;
      Then to the royal clouds
      Lifts his light pinnace
      Heedless of the boy
Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.

      Homesick for steadfast honey,
      Ah! the bee flies not
That brews that rare variety.





IV.

We play at paste,
Till qualified for pearl,
Then drop the paste,
And deem ourself a fool.
The shapes, though, were similar,
And our new hands
Learned gem-tactics
Practising sands.





V.

I found the phrase to every thought
I ever had, but one;
And that defies me, -- as a hand
Did try to chalk the sun

To races nurtured in the dark; --
How would your own begin?
Can blaze be done in cochineal,
Or noon in mazarin?





VI.

HOPE.

Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,

And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.

I 've heard it in the chillest land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me.





VII.

THE WHITE HEAT.

Dare you see a soul at the white heat?
   Then crouch within the door.
Red is the fire's common tint;
   But when the vivid ore

Has sated flame's conditions,
   Its quivering substance plays
Without a color but the light
   Of unanointed blaze.

Least village boasts its blacksmith,
   Whose anvil's even din
Stands symbol for the finer forge
   That soundless tugs within,

Refining these impatient ores
   With hammer and with blaze,
Until the designated light
   Repudiate the forge.





VIII.

TRIUMPHANT.

Who never lost, are unprepared
A coronet to find;
Who never thirsted, flagons
And cooling tamarind.

Who never climbed the weary league --
Can such a foot explore
The purple territories
On Pizarro's shore?

How many legions overcome?
The emperor will say.
How many colors taken
On Revolution Day?

How many bullets bearest?
The royal scar hast thou?
Angels, write "Promoted"
On this soldier's brow!





IX.

THE TEST.

I can wade grief,
Whole pools of it, --
I 'm used to that.
But the least push of joy
Breaks up my feet,
And I tip -- drunken.
Let no pebble smile,
'T was the new liquor, --
That was all!

Power is only pain,
Stranded, through discipline,
Till weights will hang.
Give balm to giants,
And they 'll wilt, like men.
Give Himmaleh, --
They 'll carry him!





X.

ESCAPE.

I never hear the word "escape"
Without a quicker blood,
A sudden expectation,
A flying attitude.

I never hear of prisons broad
By soldiers battered down,
But I tug childish at my bars, --
Only to fail again!






XI.

COMPENSATION.

For each ecstatic instant
We must an anguish pay
In keen and quivering ratio
To the ecstasy.

For each beloved hour
Sharp pittances of years,
Bitter contested farthings
And coffers heaped with tears.





XII.

THE MARTYRS.

Through the straight pass of suffering
The martyrs even trod,
Their feet upon temptation,
Their faces upon God.

A stately, shriven company;
Convulsion playing round,
Harmless as streaks of meteor
Upon a planet's bound.

Their faith the everlasting troth;
Their expectation fair;
The needle to the north degree
Wades so, through polar air.





XIII.

A PRAYER.

I meant to have but modest needs,
Such as content, and heaven;
Within my income these could lie,
And life and I keep even.

But since the last included both,
It would suffice my prayer
But just for one to stipulate,
And grace would grant the pair.

And so, upon this wise I prayed, --
Great Spirit, give to me
A heaven not so large as yours,
But large enough for me.

A smile suffused Jehovah's face;
The cherubim withdrew;
Grave saints stole out to look at me,
And showed their dimples, too.

I left the place with all my might, --
My prayer away I threw;
The quiet ages picked it up,
And Judgment twinkled, too,

That one so honest be extant
As take the tale for true
That "Whatsoever you shall ask,
Itself be given you."

But I, grown shrewder, scan the skies
With a suspicious air, --
As children, swindled for the first,
All swindlers be, infer.





XIV.

The thought beneath so slight a film
Is more distinctly seen, --
As laces just reveal the surge,
Or mists the Apennine.





XV.

The soul unto itself
Is an imperial friend, --
Or the most agonizing spy
An enemy could send.

Secure against its own,
No treason it can fear;
Itself its sovereign, of itself
The soul should stand in awe.





XVI.

Surgeons must be very careful
When they take the knife!
Underneath their fine incisions
Stirs the culprit, -- Life!





XVII.

THE RAILWAY TRAIN.

I like to see it lap the miles,
And lick the valleys up,
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
And then, prodigious, step

Around a pile of mountains,
And, supercilious, peer
In shanties by the sides of roads;
And then a quarry pare

To fit its sides, and crawl between,
Complaining all the while
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Then chase itself down hill

And neigh like Boanerges;
Then, punctual as a star,
Stop -- docile and omnipotent --
At its own stable door.





XVIII.

THE SHOW.

The show is not the show,
But they that go.
Menagerie to me
My neighbor be.
Fair play --
Both went to see.





XIX.

Delight becomes pictorial
When viewed through pain, --
More fair, because impossible
That any gain.

The mountain at a given distance
In amber lies;
Approached, the amber flits a little, --
And that 's the skies!





XX.

A thought went up my mind to-day
That I have had before,
But did not finish, -- some way back,
I could not fix the year,

Nor where it went, nor why it came
The second time to me,
Nor definitely what it was,
Have I the art to say.

But somewhere in my soul, I know
I 've met the thing before;
It just reminded me -- 't was all --
And came my way no more.





XXI.

Is Heaven a physician?
They say that He can heal;
But medicine posthumous
   Is unavailable.

Is Heaven an exchequer?
   They speak of what we owe;
But that negotiation
   I 'm not a party to.





XXII.

THE RETURN.

Though I get home how late, how late!
So I get home, 't will compensate.
Better will be the ecstasy
That they have done expecting me,
When, night descending, dumb and dark,
They hear my unexpected knock.
Transporting must the moment be,
Brewed from decades of agony!

To think just how the fire will burn,
Just how long-cheated eyes will turn
To wonder what myself will say,
And what itself will say to me,
Beguiles the centuries of way!





XXIII.

A poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
That sat it down to rest,
Nor noticed that the ebbing day
Flowed silver to the west,
Nor noticed night did soft descend
Nor constellation burn,
Intent upon the vision
Of latitudes unknown.

The angels, happening that way,
This dusty heart espied;
Tenderly took it up from toil
And carried it to God.
There, -- sandals for the barefoot;
There, -- gathered from the gales,
Do the blue havens by the hand
Lead the wandering sails.





XXIV.

TOO MUCH.

I should have been too glad, I see,
Too lifted for the scant degree
   Of life's penurious round;
My little circuit would have shamed
This new circumference, have blamed
   The homelier time behind.

I should have been too saved, I see,
Too rescued; fear too dim to me
   That I could spell the prayer
I knew so perfect yesterday, --
That scalding one, "Sabachthani,"
   Recited fluent here.

Earth would have been too much, I see,
And heaven not enough for me;
   I should have had the joy
Without the fear to justify, --
The palm without the Calvary;
   So, Saviour, crucify.

Defeat whets victory, they say;
The reefs in old Gethsemane
   Endear the shore beyond.
'T is beggars banquets best define;
'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, --
   Faith faints to understand.





XXV.

SHIPWRECK.

It tossed and tossed, --
A little brig I knew, --
O'ertook by blast,
It spun and spun,
And groped delirious, for morn.

It slipped and slipped,
As one that drunken stepped;
Its white foot tripped,
Then dropped from sight.

Ah, brig, good-night
To crew and you;
The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue,
To break for you.





XXVI.

Victory comes late,
And is held low to freezing lips
Too rapt with frost
To take it.
How sweet it would have tasted,
Just a drop!
Was God so economical?
His table 's spread too high for us
Unless we dine on tip-toe.
Crumbs fit such little mouths,
Cherries suit robins;
The eagle's golden breakfast
Strangles them.
God keeps his oath to sparrows,
Who of little love
Know how to starve!





XXVII.

ENOUGH.

God gave a loaf to every bird,
But just a crumb to me;
I dare not eat it, though I starve, --
My poignant luxury
To own it, touch it, prove the feat
That made the pellet mine, --
Too happy in my sparrow chance
For ampler coveting.

It might be famine all around,
I could not miss an ear,
Such plenty smiles upon my board,
My garner shows so fair.
I wonder how the rich may feel, --
An Indiaman -- an Earl?
I deem that I with but a crumb
Am sovereign of them all.





XXVIII.

Experiment to me
Is every one I meet.
If it contain a kernel?
The figure of a nut

Presents upon a tree,
Equally plausibly;
But meat within is requisite,
To squirrels and to me.





XXIX.

MY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE.

My country need not change her gown,
Her triple suit as sweet
As when 't was cut at Lexington,
And first pronounced "a fit."

Great Britain disapproves "the stars;"
Disparagement discreet, --
There 's something in their attitude
That taunts her bayonet.





XXX.

Faith is a fine invention
For gentlemen who see;
But microscopes are prudent
In an emergency!





XXXI.

Except the heaven had come so near,
So seemed to choose my door,
The distance would not haunt me so;
I had not hoped before.

But just to hear the grace depart
I never thought to see,
Afflicts me with a double loss;
'T is lost, and lost to me.





XXXII.

Portraits are to daily faces
As an evening west
To a fine, pedantic sunshine
In a satin vest.





XXXIII.

THE DUEL.

I took my power in my hand.
And went against the world;
'T was not so much as David had,
But I was twice as bold.

I aimed my pebble, but myself
Was all the one that fell.
Was it Goliath was too large,
Or only I too small?





XXXIV.

A shady friend for torrid days
Is easier to find
Than one of higher temperature
For frigid hour of mind.

The vane a little to the east
Scares muslin souls away;
If broadcloth breasts are firmer
Than those of organdy,

Who is to blame? The weaver?
Ah! the bewildering thread!
The tapestries of paradise
So notelessly are made!





XXXV.

THE GOAL.

Each life converges to some centre
Expressed or still;
Exists in every human nature
A goal,

Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
Too fair
For credibility's temerity
To dare.

Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
To reach
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment
To touch,

Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance;
How high
Unto the saints' slow diligence
The sky!

Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture,
But then,
Eternity enables the endeavoring
Again.





XXXVI.

SIGHT.

Before I got my eye put out,
I liked as well to see
As other creatures that have eyes,
And know no other way.

But were it told to me, to-day,
That I might have the sky
For mine, I tell you that my heart
Would split, for size of me.

The meadows mine, the mountains mine, --
All forests, stintless stars,
As much of noon as I could take
Between my finite eyes.

The motions of the dipping birds,
The lightning's jointed road,
For mine to look at when I liked, --
The news would strike me dead!

So safer, guess, with just my soul
Upon the window-pane
Where other creatures put their eyes,
Incautious of the sun.





XXXVII.

Talk with prudence to a beggar
Of 'Potosi' and the mines!
Reverently to the hungry
Of your viands and your wines!

Cautious, hint to any captive
You have passed enfranchised feet!
Anecdotes of air in dungeons
Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!





XXXVIII.

THE PREACHER.

He preached upon "breadth" till it argued him narrow, --
The broad are too broad to define;
And of "truth" until it proclaimed him a liar, --
The truth never flaunted a sign.

Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
As gold the pyrites would shun.
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
To meet so enabled a man!





XXXIX.

Good night! which put the candle out?
A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.
   Ah! friend, you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The angels labored diligent;
   Extinguished, now, for you!

It might have been the lighthouse spark
Some sailor, rowing in the dark,
   Had importuned to see!
It might have been the waning lamp
That lit the drummer from the camp
   To purer reveille!





XL.

When I hoped I feared,
Since I hoped I dared;
Everywhere alone
As a church remain;
Spectre cannot harm,
Serpent cannot charm;
He deposes doom,
Who hath suffered him.





XLI.

DEED.

A deed knocks first at thought,
And then it knocks at will.
That is the manufacturing spot,
And will at home and well.

It then goes out an act,
Or is entombed so still
That only to the ear of God
Its doom is audible.





XLII.

TIME'S LESSON.

Mine enemy is growing old, --
I have at last revenge.
The palate of the hate departs;
If any would avenge, --

Let him be quick, the viand flits,
It is a faded meat.
Anger as soon as fed is dead;
'T is starving makes it fat.





XLIII.

REMORSE.

Remorse is memory awake,
Her companies astir, --
A presence of departed acts
At window and at door.

It's past set down before the soul,
And lighted with a match,
Perusal to facilitate
Of its condensed despatch.

Remorse is cureless, -- the disease
Not even God can heal;
For 't is his institution, --
The complement of hell.





XLIV.

THE SHELTER.

The body grows outside, --
The more convenient way, --
That if the spirit like to hide,
Its temple stands alway

Ajar, secure, inviting;
It never did betray
The soul that asked its shelter
In timid honesty.





XLV.

Undue significance a starving man attaches
To food
Far off; he sighs, and therefore hopeless,
And therefore good.

Partaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us
That spices fly
In the receipt. It was the distance
Was savory.





XLVI.

Heart not so heavy as mine,
Wending late home,
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune, --

A careless snatch, a ballad,
A ditty of the street;
Yet to my irritated ear
An anodyne so sweet,

It was as if a bobolink,
Sauntering this way,
Carolled and mused and carolled,
Then bubbled slow away.

It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a toilsome way
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why.

To-morrow, night will come again,
Weary, perhaps, and sore.
Ah, bugle, by my window,
I pray you stroll once more!





XLVII.

I many times thought peace had come,
When peace was far away;
As wrecked men deem they sight the land
At centre of the sea,

And struggle slacker, but to prove,
As hopelessly as I,
How many the fictitious shores
Before the harbor lie.





XLVIII.

Unto my books so good to turn
Far ends of tired days;
It half endears the abstinence,
And pain is missed in praise.

As flavors cheer retarded guests
With banquetings to be,
So spices stimulate the time
Till my small library.

It may be wilderness without,
Far feet of failing men,
But holiday excludes the night,
And it is bells within.

I thank these kinsmen of the shelf;
Their countenances bland
Enamour in prospective,
And satisfy, obtained.





XLIX.

This merit hath the worst, --
It cannot be again.
When Fate hath taunted last
And thrown her furthest stone,

The maimed may pause and breathe,
And glance securely round.
The deer invites no longer
Than it eludes the hound.





L.

HUNGER.

I had been hungry all the years;
My noon had come, to dine;
I, trembling, drew the table near,
And touched the curious wine.

'T was this on tables I had seen,
When turning, hungry, lone,
I looked in windows, for the wealth
I could not hope to own.

I did not know the ample bread,
'T was so unlike the crumb
The birds and I had often shared
In Nature's dining-room.

The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, --
Myself felt ill and odd,
As berry of a mountain bush
Transplanted to the road.

Nor was I hungry; so I found
That hunger was a way
Of persons outside windows,
The entering takes away.





LI.

I gained it so,
      By climbing slow,
By catching at the twigs that grow
Between the bliss and me.
      It hung so high,
      As well the sky
      Attempt by strategy.


I said I gained it, --
      This was all.
Look, how I clutch it,
      Lest it fall,
And I a pauper go;
Unfitted by an instant's grace
For the contented beggar's face
I wore an hour ago.





LII.

To learn the transport by the pain,
As blind men learn the sun;
To die of thirst, suspecting
That brooks in meadows run;

To stay the homesick, homesick feet
Upon a foreign shore
Haunted by native lands, the while,
And blue, beloved air --

This is the sovereign anguish,
This, the signal woe!
These are the patient laureates
Whose voices, trained below,

Ascend in ceaseless carol,
Inaudible, indeed,
To us, the duller scholars
Of the mysterious bard!





LIII.

RETURNING.

I years had been from home,
And now, before the door,
I dared not open, lest a face
I never saw before

Stare vacant into mine
And ask my business there.
My business, -- just a life I left,
Was such still dwelling there?

I fumbled at my nerve,
I scanned the windows near;
The silence like an ocean rolled,
And broke against my ear.

I laughed a wooden laugh
That I could fear a door,
Who danger and the dead had faced,
But never quaked before.

I fitted to the latch
My hand, with trembling care,
Lest back the awful door should spring,
And leave me standing there.

I moved my fingers off
As cautiously as glass,
And held my ears, and like a thief
Fled gasping from the house.





LIV.

PRAYER.

Prayer is the little implement
Through which men reach
Where presence is denied them.
They fling their speech

By means of it in God's ear;
If then He hear,
This sums the apparatus
Comprised in prayer.





LV.

I know that he exists
Somewhere, in silence.
He has hid his rare life
From our gross eyes.

'T is an instant's play,
'T is a fond ambush,
Just to make bliss
Earn her own surprise!

But should the play
Prove piercing earnest,
Should the glee glaze
In death's stiff stare,

Would not the fun
Look too expensive?
Would not the jest
Have crawled too far?





LVI.

MELODIES UNHEARD.

Musicians wrestle everywhere:
All day, among the crowded air,
  I hear the silver strife;
And -- waking long before the dawn --
Such transport breaks upon the town
  I think it that "new life!"

It is not bird, it has no nest;
Nor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,
  Nor tambourine, nor man;
It is not hymn from pulpit read, --
The morning stars the treble led
  On time's first afternoon!

Some say it is the spheres at play!
Some say that bright majority
  Of vanished dames and men!
Some think it service in the place
Where we, with late, celestial face,
  Please God, shall ascertain!





LVII.

CALLED BACK.

Just lost when I was saved!
Just felt the world go by!
Just girt me for the onset with eternity,
When breath blew back,
And on the other side
I heard recede the disappointed tide!

Therefore, as one returned, I feel,
Odd secrets of the line to tell!
Some sailor, skirting foreign shores,
Some pale reporter from the awful doors
Before the seal!

Next time, to stay!
Next time, the things to see
By ear unheard,
Unscrutinized by eye.

Next time, to tarry,
While the ages steal, --
Slow tramp the centuries,
And the cycles wheel.






II. LOVE.


I.

CHOICE.

Of all the souls that stand create
I have elected one.
When sense from spirit files away,
And subterfuge is done;

When that which is and that which was
Apart, intrinsic, stand,
And this brief tragedy of flesh
Is shifted like a sand;

When figures show their royal front
And mists are carved away, --
Behold the atom I preferred
To all the lists of clay!





II.

I have no life but this,
To lead it here;
Nor any death, but lest
Dispelled from there;

Nor tie to earths to come,
Nor action new,
Except through this extent,
The realm of you.





III.

Your riches taught me poverty.
Myself a millionnaire
In little wealths, -- as girls could boast, --
Till broad as Buenos Ayre,

You drifted your dominions
A different Peru;
And I esteemed all poverty,
For life's estate with you.

Of mines I little know, myself,
But just the names of gems, --
The colors of the commonest;
And scarce of diadems

So much that, did I meet the queen,
Her glory I should know:
But this must be a different wealth,
To miss it beggars so.

I 'm sure 't is India all day
To those who look on you
Without a stint, without a blame, --
Might I but be the Jew!

I 'm sure it is Golconda,
Beyond my power to deem, --
To have a smile for mine each day,
How better than a gem!

At least, it solaces to know
That there exists a gold,
Although I prove it just in time
Its distance to behold!

It 's far, far treasure to surmise,
And estimate the pearl
That slipped my simple fingers through
While just a girl at school!





IV.

THE CONTRACT.

I gave myself to him,
And took himself for pay.
The solemn contract of a life
Was ratified this way.

The wealth might disappoint,
Myself a poorer prove
Than this great purchaser suspect,
The daily own of Love

Depreciate the vision;
But, till the merchant buy,
Still fable, in the isles of spice,
The subtle cargoes lie.

At least, 't is mutual risk, --
Some found it mutual gain;
Sweet debt of Life, -- each night to owe,
Insolvent, every noon.





V.

THE LETTER.

"GOING to him! Happy letter! Tell him --
Tell him the page I didn't write;
Tell him I only said the syntax,
And left the verb and the pronoun out.
Tell him just how the fingers hurried,
Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,
So you could see what moved them so.

"Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,
As if it held but the might of a child;
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.
Tell him -- No, you may quibble there,
For it would split his heart to know it,
And then you and I were silenter.

"Tell him night finished before we finished,
And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended --
What could it hinder so, to say?
Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,
But if he ask where you are hid
Until to-morrow, -- happy letter!
Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!"





VI.

The way I read a letter 's this:
'T is first I lock the door,
And push it with my fingers next,
For transport it be sure.

And then I go the furthest off
To counteract a knock;
Then draw my little letter forth
And softly pick its lock.

Then, glancing narrow at the wall,
And narrow at the floor,
For firm conviction of a mouse
Not exorcised before,

Peruse how infinite I am
To -- no one that you know!
And sigh for lack of heaven, -- but not
The heaven the creeds bestow.





VII.

Wild nights! Wild nights!
Were I with thee,
Wild nights should be
Our luxury!

Futile the winds
To a heart in port, --
Done with the compass,
Done with the chart.

Rowing in Eden!
Ah! the sea!
Might I but moor
To-night in thee!





VIII.

AT HOME.

The night was wide, and furnished scant
With but a single star,
That often as a cloud it met
Blew out itself for fear.

The wind pursued the little bush,
And drove away the leaves
November left; then clambered up
And fretted in the eaves.

No squirrel went abroad;
A dog's belated feet
Like intermittent plush were heard
Adown the empty street.

To feel if blinds be fast,
And closer to the fire
Her little rocking-chair to draw,
And shiver for the poor,

The housewife's gentle task.
"How pleasanter," said she
Unto the sofa opposite,
"The sleet than May -- no thee!"





IX.

POSSESSION.

Did the harebell loose her girdle
To the lover bee,
Would the bee the harebell hallow
Much as formerly?

Did the paradise, persuaded,
Yield her moat of pearl,
Would the Eden be an Eden,
Or the earl an earl?





X.

A charm invests a face
Imperfectly beheld, --
The lady dare not lift her veil
For fear it be dispelled.

But peers beyond her mesh,
And wishes, and denies, --
Lest interview annul a want
That image satisfies.





XI.

THE LOVERS.

The rose did caper on her cheek,
Her bodice rose and fell,
Her pretty speech, like drunken men,
Did stagger pitiful.

Her fingers fumbled at her work, --
Her needle would not go;
What ailed so smart a little maid
It puzzled me to know,

Till opposite I spied a cheek
That bore another rose;
Just opposite, another speech
That like the drunkard goes;

A vest that, like the bodice, danced
To the immortal tune, --
Till those two troubled little clocks
Ticked softly into one.





XII.

In lands I never saw, they say,
Immortal Alps look down,
Whose bonnets touch the firmament,
Whose sandals touch the town, --

Meek at whose everlasting feet
A myriad daisies play.
Which, sir, are you, and which am I,
Upon an August day?





XIII.

The moon is distant from the sea,
And yet with amber hands
She leads him, docile as a boy,
Along appointed sands.

He never misses a degree;
Obedient to her eye,
He comes just so far toward the town,
Just so far goes away.

Oh, Signor, thine the amber hand,
And mine the distant sea, --
Obedient to the least command
Thine eyes impose on me.





XIV.

He put the belt around my life, --
I heard the buckle snap,
And turned away, imperial,
My lifetime folding up
Deliberate, as a duke would do
A kingdom's title-deed, --
Henceforth a dedicated sort,
A member of the cloud.

Yet not too far to come at call,
And do the little toils
That make the circuit of the rest,
And deal occasional smiles
To lives that stoop to notice mine
And kindly ask it in, --
Whose invitation, knew you not
For whom I must decline?





XV.

THE LOST JEWEL.

I held a jewel in my fingers
And went to sleep.
The day was warm, and winds were prosy;
I said: "'T will keep."

I woke and chid my honest fingers, --
The gem was gone;
And now an amethyst remembrance
Is all I own.





XVI.

What if I say I shall not wait?
What if I burst the fleshly gate
And pass, escaped, to thee?
What if I file this mortal off,
See where it hurt me, -- that 's enough, --
And wade in liberty?

They cannot take us any more, --
Dungeons may call, and guns implore;
Unmeaning now, to me,
As laughter was an hour ago,
Or laces, or a travelling show,
Or who died yesterday!









III. NATURE.


I.

MOTHER NATURE.

Nature, the gentlest mother,
Impatient of no child,
The feeblest or the waywardest, --
Her admonition mild

In forest and the hill
By traveller is heard,
Restraining rampant squirrel
Or too impetuous bird.

How fair her conversation,
A summer afternoon, --
Her household, her assembly;
And when the sun goes down

Her voice among the aisles
Incites the timid prayer
Of the minutest cricket,
The most unworthy flower.

When all the children sleep
She turns as long away
As will suffice to light her lamps;
Then, bending from the sky

With infinite affection
And infiniter care,
Her golden finger on her lip,
Wills silence everywhere.





II.

OUT OF THE MORNING.

Will there really be a morning?
Is there such a thing as day?
Could I see it from the mountains
If I were as tall as they?

Has it feet like water-lilies?
Has it feathers like a bird?
Is it brought from famous countries
Of which I have never heard?

Oh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor!
Oh, some wise man from the skies!
Please to tell a little pilgrim
Where the place called morning lies!





III.

At half-past three a single bird
Unto a silent sky
Propounded but a single term
Of cautious melody.

At half-past four, experiment
Had subjugated test,
And lo! her silver principle
Supplanted all the rest.

At half-past seven, element
Nor implement was seen,
And place was where the presence was,
Circumference between.





IV.

DAY'S PARLOR.

The day came slow, till five o'clock,
Then sprang before the hills
Like hindered rubies, or the light
A sudden musket spills.

The purple could not keep the east,
The sunrise shook from fold,
Like breadths of topaz, packed a night,
The lady just unrolled.

The happy winds their timbrels took;
The birds, in docile rows,
Arranged themselves around their prince
(The wind is prince of those).

The orchard sparkled like a Jew, --
How mighty 't was, to stay
A guest in this stupendous place,
The parlor of the day!





V.

THE SUN'S WOOING.

The sun just touched the morning;
The morning, happy thing,
Supposed that he had come to dwell,
And life would be all spring.

She felt herself supremer, --
A raised, ethereal thing;
Henceforth for her what holiday!
Meanwhile, her wheeling king

Trailed slow along the orchards
His haughty, spangled hems,
Leaving a new necessity, --
The want of diadems!

The morning fluttered, staggered,
Felt feebly for her crown, --
Her unanointed forehead
Henceforth her only one.






VI.

THE ROBIN.

The robin is the one
That interrupts the morn
With hurried, few, express reports
When March is scarcely on.

The robin is the one
That overflows the noon
With her cherubic quantity,
An April but begun.

The robin is the one
That speechless from her nest
Submits that home and certainty
And sanctity are best.





VII.

THE BUTTERFLY'S DAY.

From cocoon forth a butterfly
As lady from her door
Emerged -- a summer afternoon --
Repairing everywhere,

Without design, that I could trace,
Except to stray abroad
On miscellaneous enterprise
The clovers understood.

Her pretty parasol was seen
Contracting in a field
Where men made hay, then struggling hard
With an opposing cloud,

Where parties, phantom as herself,
To Nowhere seemed to go
In purposeless circumference,
As 't were a tropic show.

And notwithstanding bee that worked,
And flower that zealous blew,
This audience of idleness
Disdained them, from the sky,

Till sundown crept, a steady tide,
And men that made the hay,
And afternoon, and butterfly,
Extinguished in its sea.





VIII.

THE BLUEBIRD.

Before you thought of spring,
Except as a surmise,
You see, God bless his suddenness,
A fellow in the skies
Of independent hues,
A little weather-worn,
Inspiriting habiliments
Of indigo and brown.

With specimens of song,
As if for you to choose,
Discretion in the interval,
With gay delays he goes
To some superior tree
Without a single leaf,
And shouts for joy to nobody
But his seraphic self!





IX.

APRIL.

An altered look about the hills;
A Tyrian light the village fills;
A wider sunrise in the dawn;
A deeper twilight on the lawn;
A print of a vermilion foot;
A purple finger on the slope;
A flippant fly upon the pane;
A spider at his trade again;
An added strut in chanticleer;
A flower expected everywhere;
An axe shrill singing in the woods;
Fern-odors on untravelled roads, --
All this, and more I cannot tell,
A furtive look you know as well,
And Nicodemus' mystery
Receives its annual reply.





X.

THE SLEEPING FLOWERS.

"Whose are the little beds," I asked,
"Which in the valleys lie?"
Some shook their heads, and others smiled,
And no one made reply.

"Perhaps they did not hear," I said;
"I will inquire again.
Whose are the beds, the tiny beds
So thick upon the plain?"

"'T is daisy in the shortest;
A little farther on,
Nearest the door to wake the first,
Little leontodon.

"'T is iris, sir, and aster,
Anemone and bell,
Batschia in the blanket red,
And chubby daffodil."

Meanwhile at many cradles
Her busy foot she plied,
Humming the quaintest lullaby
That ever rocked a child.

"Hush! Epigea wakens! --
The crocus stirs her lids,
Rhodora's cheek is crimson, --
She's dreaming of the woods."

Then, turning from them, reverent,
"Their bed-time 't is," she said;
"The bumble-bees will wake them
When April woods are red."





XI.

MY ROSE.

Pigmy seraphs gone astray,
Velvet people from Vevay,
Belles from some lost summer day,
Bees' exclusive coterie.
Paris could not lay the fold
Belted down with emerald;
Venice could not show a cheek
Of a tint so lustrous meek.
Never such an ambuscade
As of brier and leaf displayed
For my little damask maid.
I had rather wear her grace
Than an earl's distinguished face;
I had rather dwell like her
Than be Duke of Exeter
Royalty enough for me
To subdue the bumble-bee!





XII.

THE ORIOLE'S SECRET.

To hear an oriole sing
May be a common thing,
Or only a divine.

It is not of the bird
Who sings the same, unheard,
As unto crowd.

The fashion of the ear
Attireth that it hear
In dun or fair.

So whether it be rune,
Or whether it be none,
Is of within;

The "tune is in the tree,"
The sceptic showeth me;
"No, sir! In thee!"





XIII.

THE ORIOLE.

One of the ones that Midas touched,
Who failed to touch us all,
Was that confiding prodigal,
The blissful oriole.

So drunk, he disavows it
With badinage divine;
So dazzling, we mistake him
For an alighting mine.

A pleader, a dissembler,
An epicure, a thief, --
Betimes an oratorio,
An ecstasy in chief;

The Jesuit of orchards,
He cheats as he enchants
Of an entire attar
For his decamping wants.

The splendor of a Burmah,
The meteor of birds,
Departing like a pageant
Of ballads and of bards.

I never thought that Jason sought
For any golden fleece;
But then I am a rural man,
With thoughts that make for peace.

But if there were a Jason,
Tradition suffer me
Behold his lost emolument
Upon the apple-tree.





XIV.

IN SHADOW.

I dreaded that first robin so,
But he is mastered now,
And I 'm accustomed to him grown, --
He hurts a little, though.

I thought if I could only live
Till that first shout got by,
Not all pianos in the woods
Had power to mangle me.

I dared not meet the daffodils,
For fear their yellow gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own.

I wished the grass would hurry,
So when 't was time to see,
He 'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch to look at me.

I could not bear the bees should come,
I wished they 'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go:
What word had they for me?

They 're here, though; not a creature failed,
No blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me,
The Queen of Calvary.

Each one salutes me as he goes,
And I my childish plumes
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking drums.





XV.

THE HUMMING-BIRD.

A route of evanescence
With a revolving wheel;
A resonance of emerald,
A rush of cochineal;
And every blossom on the bush
Adjusts its tumbled head, --
The mail from Tunis, probably,
An easy morning's ride.





XVI.

SECRETS.

The skies can't keep their secret!
They tell it to the hills --
The hills just tell the orchards --
And they the daffodils!

A bird, by chance, that goes that way
Soft overheard the whole.
If I should bribe the little bird,
Who knows but she would tell?

I think I won't, however,
It's finer not to know;
If summer were an axiom,
What sorcery had snow?

So keep your secret, Father!
I would not, if I could,
Know what the sapphire fellows do,
In your new-fashioned world!





XVII.

Who robbed the woods,
The trusting woods?
The unsuspecting trees
Brought out their burrs and mosses
His fantasy to please.
He scanned their trinkets, curious,
He grasped, he bore away.
What will the solemn hemlock,
What will the fir-tree say?





XVIII.

TWO VOYAGERS.

Two butterflies went out at noon
And waltzed above a stream,
Then stepped straight through the firmament
And rested on a beam;

And then together bore away
Upon a shining sea, --
Though never yet, in any port,
Their coming mentioned be.

If spoken by the distant bird,
If met in ether sea
By frigate or by merchantman,
Report was not to me.





XIX.

BY THE SEA.

I started early, took my dog,
And visited the sea;
The mermaids in the basement
Came out to look at me,

And frigates in the upper floor
Extended hempen hands,
Presuming me to be a mouse
Aground, upon the sands.

But no man moved me till the tide
Went past my simple shoe,
And past my apron and my belt,
And past my bodice too,

And made as he would eat me up
As wholly as a dew
Upon a dandelion's sleeve --
And then I started too.

And he -- he followed close behind;
I felt his silver heel
Upon my ankle, -- then my shoes
Would overflow with pearl.

Until we met the solid town,
No man he seemed to know;
And bowing with a mighty look
At me, the sea withdrew.





XX.

OLD-FASHIONED.

Arcturus is his other name, --
I'd rather call him star!
It's so unkind of science
To go and interfere!

I pull a flower from the woods, --
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath,
And has her in a class.

Whereas I took the butterfly
Aforetime in my hat,
He sits erect in cabinets,
The clover-bells forgot.

What once was heaven, is zenith now.
Where I proposed to go
When time's brief masquerade was done,
Is mapped, and charted too!

What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I 'm ready for the worst,
Whatever prank betides!

Perhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!
I hope the children there
Won't be new-fashioned when I come,
And laugh at me, and stare!

I hope the father in the skies
Will lift his little girl, --
Old-fashioned, naughty, everything, --
Over the stile of pearl!





XXI.

A TEMPEST.

An awful tempest mashed the air,
The clouds were gaunt and few;
A black, as of a spectre's cloak,
Hid heaven and earth from view.

The creatures chuckled on the roofs
And whistled in the air,
And shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.
And swung their frenzied hair.

The morning lit, the birds arose;
The monster's faded eyes
Turned slowly to his native coast,
And peace was Paradise!





XXII.

THE SEA.

An everywhere of silver,
With ropes of sand
To keep it from effacing
The track called land.





XXIII.

IN THE GARDEN.

A bird came down the walk:
He did not know I saw;
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass,
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
To let a beetle pass.

He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad, --
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;
He stirred his velvet head

Like one in danger; cautious,
I offered him a crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home

Than oars divide the ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
Leap, plashless, as they swim.





XXIV.

THE SNAKE.

A narrow fellow in the grass
Occasionally rides;
You may have met him, -- did you not,
His notice sudden is.

The grass divides as with a comb,
A spotted shaft is seen;
And then it closes at your feet
And opens further on.

He likes a boggy acre,
A floor too cool for corn.
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
I more than once, at morn,

Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
Unbraiding in the sun, --
When, stooping to secure it,
It wrinkled, and was gone.

Several of nature's people
I know, and they know me;
I feel for them a transport
Of cordiality;

But never met this fellow,
Attended or alone,
Without a tighter breathing,
And zero at the bone.





XXV.

THE MUSHROOM.

The mushroom is the elf of plants,
At evening it is not;
At morning in a truffled hut
It stops upon a spot

As if it tarried always;
And yet its whole career
Is shorter than a snake's delay,
And fleeter than a tare.

'T is vegetation's juggler,
The germ of alibi;
Doth like a bubble antedate,
And like a bubble hie.

I feel as if the grass were pleased
To have it intermit;
The surreptitious scion
Of summer's circumspect.

Had nature any outcast face,
Could she a son contemn,
Had nature an Iscariot,
That mushroom, -- it is him.





XXVI.

THE STORM.

There came a wind like a bugle;
It quivered through the grass,
And a green chill upon the heat
So ominous did pass
We barred the windows and the doors
As from an emerald ghost;
The doom's electric moccason
That very instant passed.
On a strange mob of panting trees,
And fences fled away,
And rivers where the houses ran
The living looked that day.
The bell within the steeple wild
The flying tidings whirled.
How much can come
And much can go,
And yet abide the world!





XXVII.

THE SPIDER.

A spider sewed at night
Without a light
Upon an arc of white.
If ruff it was of dame
Or shroud of gnome,
Himself, himself inform.
Of immortality
His strategy
Was physiognomy.





XXVIII.

I know a place where summer strives
With such a practised frost,
She each year leads her daisies back,
Recording briefly, "Lost."

But when the south wind stirs the pools
And struggles in the lanes,
Her heart misgives her for her vow,
And she pours soft refrains

Into the lap of adamant,
And spices, and the dew,
That stiffens quietly to quartz,
Upon her amber shoe.





XXIX.

The one that could repeat the summer day
Were greater than itself, though he
Minutest of mankind might be.
And who could reproduce the sun,
At period of going down --
The lingering and the stain, I mean --
When Orient has been outgrown,
And Occident becomes unknown,
His name remain.





XXX.

THE WlND'S VISIT.

The wind tapped like a tired man,
And like a host, "Come in,"
I boldly answered; entered then
My residence within

A rapid, footless guest,
To offer whom a chair
Were as impossible as hand
A sofa to the air.

No bone had he to bind him,
His speech was like the push
Of numerous humming-birds at once
From a superior bush.

His countenance a billow,
His fingers, if he pass,
Let go a music, as of tunes
Blown tremulous in glass.

He visited, still flitting;
Then, like a timid man,
Again he tapped -- 't was flurriedly --
And I became alone.





XXXI.

Nature rarer uses yellow
   Than another hue;
Saves she all of that for sunsets, --
   Prodigal of blue,

Spending scarlet like a woman,
   Yellow she affords
Only scantly and selectly,
   Like a lover's words.





XXXII.

GOSSIP.

The leaves, like women, interchange
  Sagacious confidence;
Somewhat of nods, and somewhat of
  Portentous inference,

The parties in both cases
  Enjoining secrecy, --
Inviolable compact
  To notoriety.





XXXIII.

SIMPLICITY.

How happy is the little stone
That rambles in the road alone,
And doesn't care about careers,
And exigencies never fears;
Whose coat of elemental brown
A passing universe put on;
And independent as the sun,
Associates or glows alone,
Fulfilling absolute decree
In casual simplicity.





XXXIV.

STORM.

It sounded as if the streets were running,
And then the streets stood still.
Eclipse was all we could see at the window,
And awe was all we could feel.

By and by the boldest stole out of his covert,
To see if time was there.
Nature was in her beryl apron,
Mixing fresher air.





XXXV.

THE RAT.

The rat is the concisest tenant.
He pays no rent, --
Repudiates the obligation,
On schemes intent.

Balking our wit
To sound or circumvent,
Hate cannot harm
A foe so reticent.

Neither decree
Prohibits him,
Lawful as
Equilibrium.





XXXVI.

Frequently the woods are pink,
Frequently are brown;
Frequently the hills undress
Behind my native town.

Oft a head is crested
I was wont to see,
And as oft a cranny
Where it used to be.

And the earth, they tell me,
On its axis turned, --
Wonderful rotation
By but twelve performed!





XXXVII.

A THUNDER-STORM.

The wind begun to rock the grass
With threatening tunes and low, --
He flung a menace at the earth,
A menace at the sky.

The leaves unhooked themselves from trees
And started all abroad;
The dust did scoop itself like hands
And throw away the road.

The wagons quickened on the streets,
The thunder hurried slow;
The lightning showed a yellow beak,
And then a livid claw.

The birds put up the bars to nests,
The cattle fled to barns;
There came one drop of giant rain,
And then, as if the hands

That held the dams had parted hold,
The waters wrecked the sky,
But overlooked my father's house,
Just quartering a tree.





XXXVIII.

WITH FLOWERS.

South winds jostle them,
Bumblebees come,
Hover, hesitate,
Drink, and are gone.

Butterflies pause
On their passage Cashmere;
I, softly plucking,
Present them here!





XXXIX.

SUNSET.

Where ships of purple gently toss
On seas of daffodil,
Fantastic sailors mingle,
And then -- the wharf is still.





XL.

She sweeps with many-colored brooms,
And leaves the shreds behind;
Oh, housewife in the evening west,
Come back, and dust the pond!

You dropped a purple ravelling in,
You dropped an amber thread;
And now you 've littered all the East
With duds of emerald!

And still she plies her spotted brooms,
And still the aprons fly,
Till brooms fade softly into stars --
And then I come away.





XLI.

Like mighty footlights burned the red
At bases of the trees, --
The far theatricals of day
Exhibiting to these.

'T was universe that did applaud
While, chiefest of the crowd,
Enabled by his royal dress,
Myself distinguished God.





XLII.

PROBLEMS.

Bring me the sunset in a cup,
Reckon the morning's flagons up,
   And say how many dew;
Tell me how far the morning leaps,
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
   Who spun the breadths of blue!

Write me how many notes there be
In the new robin's ecstasy
   Among astonished boughs;
How many trips the tortoise makes,
How many cups the bee partakes, --
   The debauchee of dews!

Also, who laid the rainbow's piers,
Also, who leads the docile spheres
   By withes of supple blue?
Whose fingers string the stalactite,
Who counts the wampum of the night,
   To see that none is due?

Who built this little Alban house
And shut the windows down so close
   My spirit cannot see?
Who 'll let me out some gala day,
With implements to fly away,
   Passing pomposity?





XLIII.

THE JUGGLER OF DAY.

Blazing in gold and quenching in purple,
Leaping like leopards to the sky,
Then at the feet of the old horizon
Laying her spotted face, to die;

Stooping as low as the otter's window,
Touching the roof and tinting the barn,
Kissing her bonnet to the meadow, --
And the juggler of day is gone!




XLIV.

MY CRICKET.

Farther in summer than the birds,
Pathetic from the grass,
A minor nation celebrates
Its unobtrusive mass.

No ordinance is seen,
So gradual the grace,
A pensive custom it becomes,
Enlarging loneliness.

Antiquest felt at noon
When August, burning low,
Calls forth this spectral canticle,
Repose to typify.

Remit as yet no grace,
No furrow on the glow,
Yet a druidic difference
Enhances nature now.




XLV.

As imperceptibly as grief
The summer lapsed away, --
Too imperceptible, at last,
To seem like perfidy.

A quietness distilled,
As twilight long begun,
Or Nature, spending with herself
Sequestered afternoon.

The dusk drew earlier in,
The morning foreign shone, --
A courteous, yet harrowing grace,
As guest who would be gone.

And thus, without a wing,
Or service of a keel,
Our summer made her light escape
Into the beautiful.





XLVI.

It can't be summer, -- that got through;
It 's early yet for spring;
There 's that long town of white to cross
Before the blackbirds sing.

It can't be dying, -- it's too rouge, --
The dead shall go in white.
So sunset shuts my question down
With clasps of chrysolite.





XLVII.

SUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.

The gentian weaves her fringes,
The maple's loom is red.
My departing blossoms
Obviate parade.

A brief, but patient illness,
An hour to prepare;
And one, below this morning,
Is where the angels are.

It was a short procession, --
The bobolink was there,
An aged bee addressed us,
And then we knelt in prayer.

We trust that she was willing, --
We ask that we may be.
Summer, sister, seraph,
Let us go with thee!

In the name of the bee
And of the butterfly
And of the breeze, amen!





XLVIII.

FRINGED GENTIAN.

God made a little gentian;
It tried to be a rose
And failed, and all the summer laughed.
But just before the snows
There came a purple creature
That ravished all the hill;
And summer hid her forehead,
And mockery was still.
The frosts were her condition;
The Tyrian would not come
Until the North evoked it.
"Creator! shall I bloom?"





XLIX.

NOVEMBER.

Besides the autumn poets sing,
A few prosaic days
A little this side of the snow
And that side of the haze.

A few incisive mornings,
A few ascetic eyes, --
Gone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod,
And Mr. Thomson's sheaves.

Still is the bustle in the brook,
Sealed are the spicy valves;
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
The eyes of many elves.

Perhaps a squirrel may remain,
My sentiments to share.
Grant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,
Thy windy will to bear!





L.

THE SNOW.

It sifts from leaden sieves,
It powders all the wood,
It fills with alabaster wool
The wrinkles of the road.

It makes an even face
Of mountain and of plain, --
Unbroken forehead from the east
Unto the east again.

It reaches to the fence,
It wraps it, rail by rail,
Till it is lost in fleeces;
It flings a crystal veil

On stump and stack and stem, --
The summer's empty room,
Acres of seams where harvests were,
Recordless, but for them.

It ruffles wrists of posts,
As ankles of a queen, --
Then stills its artisans like ghosts,
Denying they have been.





LI.

THE BLUE JAY.

No brigadier throughout the year
So civic as the jay.
A neighbor and a warrior too,
With shrill felicity

Pursuing winds that censure us
A February day,
The brother of the universe
Was never blown away.

The snow and he are intimate;
I 've often seen them play
When heaven looked upon us all
With such severity,

I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky,
Whose pompous frown was nutriment
To their temerity.

The pillow of this daring head
Is pungent evergreens;
His larder -- terse and militant --
Unknown, refreshing things;

His character a tonic,
His future a dispute;
Unfair an immortality
That leaves this neighbor out.






IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.


I.

Let down the bars, O Death!
The tired flocks come in
Whose bleating ceases to repeat,
Whose wandering is done.

Thine is the stillest night,
Thine the securest fold;
Too near thou art for seeking thee,
Too tender to be told.





II.

Going to heaven!
I don't know when,
Pray do not ask me how, --
Indeed, I 'm too astonished
To think of answering you!
Going to heaven! --
How dim it sounds!
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the shepherd's arm!

Perhaps you 're going too!
Who knows?
If you should get there first,
Save just a little place for me
Close to the two I lost!

The smallest "robe" will fit me,
And just a bit of "crown;"
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home.

I 'm glad I don't believe it,
For it would stop my breath,
And I 'd like to look a little more
At such a curious earth!
I am glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the mighty autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground.





III.

At least to pray is left, is left.
O Jesus! in the air
I know not which thy chamber is, --
I 'm knocking everywhere.

Thou stirrest earthquake in the South,
And maelstrom in the sea;
Say, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
Hast thou no arm for me?





IV.

EPITAPH.

Step lightly on this narrow spot!
The broadest land that grows
Is not so ample as the breast
These emerald seams enclose.

Step lofty; for this name is told
As far as cannon dwell,
Or flag subsist, or fame export
Her deathless syllable.





V.

Morns like these we parted;
Noons like these she rose,
Fluttering first, then firmer,
To her fair repose.

Never did she lisp it,
And 't was not for me;
She was mute from transport,
I, from agony!

Till the evening, nearing,
One the shutters drew --
Quick! a sharper rustling!
And this linnet flew!





VI.

A death-blow is a life-blow to some
Who, till they died, did not alive become;
Who, had they lived, had died, but when
They died, vitality begun.





VII.

I read my sentence steadily,
Reviewed it with my eyes,
To see that I made no mistake
In its extremest clause, --

The date, and manner of the shame;
And then the pious form
That "God have mercy" on the soul
The jury voted him.

I made my soul familiar
With her extremity,
That at the last it should not be
A novel agony,

But she and Death, acquainted,
Meet tranquilly as friends,
Salute and pass without a hint --
And there the matter ends.





VIII.

I have not told my garden yet,
Lest that should conquer me;
I have not quite the strength now
To break it to the bee.

I will not name it in the street,
For shops would stare, that I,
So shy, so very ignorant,
Should have the face to die.

The hillsides must not know it,
Where I have rambled so,
Nor tell the loving forests
The day that I shall go,

Nor lisp it at the table,
Nor heedless by the way
Hint that within the riddle
One will walk to-day!





IX.

THE BATTLE-FIELD.

They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,
   Like petals from a rose,
When suddenly across the June
   A wind with fingers goes.

They perished in the seamless grass, --
   No eye could find the place;
But God on his repealless list
   Can summon every face.





X.

The only ghost I ever saw
Was dressed in mechlin, -- so;
He wore no sandal on his foot,
And stepped like flakes of snow.
His gait was soundless, like the bird,
But rapid, like the roe;
His fashions quaint, mosaic,
Or, haply, mistletoe.

His conversation seldom,
His laughter like the breeze
That dies away in dimples
Among the pensive trees.
Our interview was transient,--
Of me, himself was shy;
And God forbid I look behind
Since that appalling day!





XI.

Some, too fragile for winter winds,
The thoughtful grave encloses, --
Tenderly tucking them in from frost
Before their feet are cold.

Never the treasures in her nest
The cautious grave exposes,
Building where schoolboy dare not look
And sportsman is not bold.

This covert have all the children
Early aged, and often cold, --
Sparrows unnoticed by the Father;
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.





XII.

As by the dead we love to sit,
Become so wondrous dear,
As for the lost we grapple,
Though all the rest are here, --

In broken mathematics
We estimate our prize,
Vast, in its fading ratio,
To our penurious eyes!





XIII.

MEMORIALS.

Death sets a thing significant
The eye had hurried by,
Except a perished creature
Entreat us tenderly

To ponder little workmanships
In crayon or in wool,
With "This was last her fingers did,"
Industrious until

The thimble weighed too heavy,
The stitches stopped themselves,
And then 't was put among the dust
Upon the closet shelves.

A book I have, a friend gave,
Whose pencil, here and there,
Had notched the place that pleased him, --
At rest his fingers are.

Now, when I read, I read not,
For interrupting tears
Obliterate the etchings
Too costly for repairs.





XIV.

I went to heaven, --
'T was a small town,
Lit with a ruby,
Lathed with down.
Stiller than the fields
At the full dew,
Beautiful as pictures
No man drew.
People like the moth,
Of mechlin, frames,
Duties of gossamer,
And eider names.
Almost contented
I could be
'Mong such unique
Society.





XV.

Their height in heaven comforts not,
Their glory nought to me;
'T was best imperfect, as it was;
I 'm finite, I can't see.

The house of supposition,
The glimmering frontier
That skirts the acres of perhaps,
To me shows insecure.

The wealth I had contented me;
If 't was a meaner size,
Then I had counted it until
It pleased my narrow eyes

Better than larger values,
However true their show;
This timid life of evidence
Keeps pleading, "I don't know."





XVI.

There is a shame of nobleness
Confronting sudden pelf, --
A finer shame of ecstasy
Convicted of itself.

A best disgrace a brave man feels,
Acknowledged of the brave, --
One more "Ye Blessed" to be told;
But this involves the grave.





XVII.

TRIUMPH.

Triumph may be of several kinds.
There 's triumph in the room
When that old imperator, Death,
By faith is overcome.

There 's triumph of the finer mind
When truth, affronted long,
Advances calm to her supreme,
Her God her only throng.

A triumph when temptation's bribe
Is slowly handed back,
One eye upon the heaven renounced
And one upon the rack.

Severer triumph, by himself
Experienced, who can pass
Acquitted from that naked bar,
Jehovah's countenance!





XVIII.

Pompless no life can pass away;
    The lowliest career
To the same pageant wends its way
    As that exalted here.
How cordial is the mystery!
    The hospitable pall
A "this way" beckons spaciously, --
    A miracle for all!





XIX.

I noticed people disappeared,
When but a little child, --
Supposed they visited remote,
Or settled regions wild.

Now know I they both visited
And settled regions wild,
But did because they died, -- a fact
Withheld the little child!





XX.

FOLLOWING.

I had no cause to be awake,
My best was gone to sleep,
And morn a new politeness took,
And failed to wake them up,

But called the others clear,
And passed their curtains by.
Sweet morning, when I over-sleep,
Knock, recollect, for me!

I looked at sunrise once,
And then I looked at them,
And wishfulness in me arose
For circumstance the same.

'T was such an ample peace,
It could not hold a sigh, --
'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,
'T was sunset all the day.

So choosing but a gown
And taking but a prayer,
The only raiment I should need,
I struggled, and was there.





XXI.

If anybody's friend be dead,
It 's sharpest of the theme
The thinking how they walked alive,
At such and such a time.

Their costume, of a Sunday,
Some manner of the hair, --
A prank nobody knew but them,
Lost, in the sepulchre.

How warm they were on such a day:
You almost feel the date,
So short way off it seems; and now,
They 're centuries from that.

How pleased they were at what you said;
You try to touch the smile,
And dip your fingers in the frost:
When was it, can you tell,

You asked the company to tea,
Acquaintance, just a few,
And chatted close with this grand thing
That don't remember you?

Past bows and invitations,
Past interview, and vow,
Past what ourselves can estimate, --
That makes the quick of woe!





XXII.

THE JOURNEY.

Our journey had advanced;
Our feet were almost come
To that odd fork in Being's road,
Eternity by term.

Our pace took sudden awe,
Our feet reluctant led.
Before were cities, but between,
The forest of the dead.

Retreat was out of hope, --
Behind, a sealed route,
Eternity's white flag before,
And God at every gate.





XXIII.

A COUNTRY BURIAL.

Ample make this bed.
Make this bed with awe;
In it wait till judgment break
Excellent and fair.

Be its mattress straight,
Be its pillow round;
Let no sunrise' yellow noise
Interrupt this ground.





XXIV.

GOING.

On such a night, or such a night,
Would anybody care
If such a little figure
Slipped quiet from its chair,

So quiet, oh, how quiet!
That nobody might know
But that the little figure
Rocked softer, to and fro?

On such a dawn, or such a dawn,
Would anybody sigh
That such a little figure
Too sound asleep did lie

For chanticleer to wake it, --
Or stirring house below,
Or giddy bird in orchard,
Or early task to do?

There was a little figure plump
For every little knoll,
Busy needles, and spools of thread,
And trudging feet from school.

Playmates, and holidays, and nuts,
And visions vast and small.
Strange that the feet so precious charged
Should reach so small a goal!





XXV.

Essential oils are wrung:
The attar from the rose
Is not expressed by suns alone,
It is the gift of screws.

The general rose decays;
But this, in lady's drawer,
Makes summer when the lady lies
In ceaseless rosemary.




XXVI.

I lived on dread; to those who know
The stimulus there is
In danger, other impetus
Is numb and vital-less.

As 't were a spur upon the soul,
A fear will urge it where
To go without the spectre's aid
Were challenging despair.





XXVII.

If I should die,
And you should live,
And time should gurgle on,
And morn should beam,
And noon should burn,
As it has usual done;
If birds should build as early,
And bees as bustling go, --
One might depart at option
From enterprise below!
'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand
When we with daisies lie,
That commerce will continue,
And trades as briskly fly.
It makes the parting tranquil
And keeps the soul serene,
That gentlemen so sprightly
Conduct the pleasing scene!





XXVIII.

AT LENGTH.

Her final summer was it,
And yet we guessed it not;
If tenderer industriousness
Pervaded her, we thought

A further force of life
Developed from within, --
When Death lit all the shortness up,
And made the hurry plain.

We wondered at our blindness, --
When nothing was to see
But her Carrara guide-post, --
At our stupidity,

When, duller than our dulness,
The busy darling lay,
So busy was she, finishing,
So leisurely were we!





XXIX.

GHOSTS.

One need not be a chamber to be haunted,
One need not be a house;
The brain has corridors surpassing
Material place.

Far safer, of a midnight meeting
External ghost,
Than an interior confronting
That whiter host.

Far safer through an Abbey gallop,
The stones achase,
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter
In lonesome place.

Ourself, behind ourself concealed,
Should startle most;
Assassin, hid in our apartment,
Be horror's least.

The prudent carries a revolver,
He bolts the door,
O'erlooking a superior spectre
More near.





XXX.

VANISHED.

She died, -- this was the way she died;
And when her breath was done,
Took up her simple wardrobe
And started for the sun.

Her little figure at the gate
The angels must have spied,
Since I could never find her
Upon the mortal side.





XXXI.

PRECEDENCE.

Wait till the majesty of Death
Invests so mean a brow!
Almost a powdered footman
Might dare to touch it now!

Wait till in everlasting robes
This democrat is dressed,
Then prate about "preferment"
And "station" and the rest!

Around this quiet courtier
Obsequious angels wait!
Full royal is his retinue,
Full purple is his state!

A lord might dare to lift the hat
To such a modest clay,
Since that my Lord, "the Lord of lords"
Receives unblushingly!





XXXII.

GONE.

Went up a year this evening!
I recollect it well!
Amid no bells nor bravos
The bystanders will tell!
Cheerful, as to the village,
Tranquil, as to repose,
Chastened, as to the chapel,
This humble tourist rose.
Did not talk of returning,
Alluded to no time
When, were the gales propitious,
We might look for him;
Was grateful for the roses
In life's diverse bouquet,
Talked softly of new species
To pick another day.

Beguiling thus the wonder,
The wondrous nearer drew;
Hands bustled at the moorings --
The crowd respectful grew.
Ascended from our vision
To countenances new!
A difference, a daisy,
Is all the rest I knew!





XXXIII.

REQUIEM.

Taken from men this morning,
Carried by men to-day,
Met by the gods with banners
Who marshalled her away.

One little maid from playmates,
One little mind from school, --
There must be guests in Eden;
All the rooms are full.

Far as the east from even,
Dim as the border star, --
Courtiers quaint, in kingdoms,
Our departed are.





XXXIV.

What inn is this
Where for the night
Peculiar traveller comes?
Who is the landlord?
Where the maids?
Behold, what curious rooms!
No ruddy fires on the hearth,
No brimming tankards flow.
Necromancer, landlord,
Who are these below?





XXXV.

It was not death, for I stood up,
And all the dead lie down;
It was not night, for all the bells
Put out their tongues, for noon.

It was not frost, for on my flesh
I felt siroccos crawl, --
Nor fire, for just my marble feet
Could keep a chancel cool.

And yet it tasted like them all;
The figures I have seen
Set orderly, for burial,
Reminded me of mine,

As if my life were shaven
And fitted to a frame,
And could not breathe without a key;
And 't was like midnight, some,

When everything that ticked has stopped,
And space stares, all around,
Or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,
Repeal the beating ground.

But most like chaos, -- stopless, cool, --
Without a chance or spar,
Or even a report of land
To justify despair.





XXXVI.

TILL THE END.

I should not dare to leave my friend,
Because -- because if he should die
While I was gone, and I -- too late --
Should reach the heart that wanted me;

If I should disappoint the eyes
That hunted, hunted so, to see,
And could not bear to shut until
They "noticed" me -- they noticed me;

If I should stab the patient faith
So sure I 'd come -- so sure I 'd come,
It listening, listening, went to sleep
Telling my tardy name, --

My heart would wish it broke before,
Since breaking then, since breaking then,
Were useless as next morning's sun,
Where midnight frosts had lain!





XXXVII.

VOID.

Great streets of silence led away
To neighborhoods of pause;
Here was no notice, no dissent,
No universe, no laws.

By clocks 't was morning, and for night
The bells at distance called;
But epoch had no basis here,
For period exhaled.





XXXVIII.

A throe upon the features
A hurry in the breath,
An ecstasy of parting
Denominated "Death," --

An anguish at the mention,
Which, when to patience grown,
I 've known permission given
To rejoin its own.





XXXIX.

SAVED!

Of tribulation these are they
Denoted by the white;
The spangled gowns, a lesser rank
Of victors designate.

All these did conquer; but the ones
Who overcame most times
Wear nothing commoner than snow,
No ornament but palms.

Surrender is a sort unknown
On this superior soil;
Defeat, an outgrown anguish,
Remembered as the mile

Our panting ankle barely gained
When night devoured the road;
But we stood whispering in the house,
And all we said was "Saved"!





XL.

I think just how my shape will rise
When I shall be forgiven,
Till hair and eyes and timid head
Are out of sight, in heaven.

I think just how my lips will weigh
With shapeless, quivering prayer
That you, so late, consider me,
The sparrow of your care.

I mind me that of anguish sent,
Some drifts were moved away
Before my simple bosom broke, --
And why not this, if they?

And so, until delirious borne
I con that thing, -- "forgiven," --
Till with long fright and longer trust
I drop my heart, unshriven!





XLI.

THE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.

After a hundred years
Nobody knows the place, --
Agony, that enacted there,
Motionless as peace.

Weeds triumphant ranged,
Strangers strolled and spelled
At the lone orthography
Of the elder dead.

Winds of summer fields
Recollect the way, --
Instinct picking up the key
Dropped by memory.





XLII.

Lay this laurel on the one
Too intrinsic for renown.
Laurel! veil your deathless tree, --
Him you chasten, that is he!








POEMS

by EMILY DICKINSON

Third Series




Edited by

MABEL LOOMIS TODD



    It's all I have to bring to-day,
      This, and my heart beside,
    This, and my heart, and all the fields,
      And all the meadows wide.
    Be sure you count, should I forget, --
      Some one the sum could tell, --
    This, and my heart, and all the bees
      Which in the clover dwell.



PREFACE.

The intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great that
a large and characteristic choice is still possible among her
literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put
forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her
peculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson's prose was rhythmic,
--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines.

Also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in
letters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her
_Letters_. It has not been necessary, however, to include them in
this Series, and all have been omitted, except three or four
exceptionally strong ones, as "A Book," and "With Flowers."

There is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply
spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward
circumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;
for example, the verses "I had a Guinea golden," which seem to
have been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty
reminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in
which any of Emily Dickinson's verses are known to have been
written usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the
present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to
those who apprehend this scintillating spirit.

                                        M. L. T.

AMHERST, _October_, 1896.




I. LIFE.


I.

REAL RICHES.

'T is little I could care for pearls
  Who own the ample sea;
Or brooches, when the Emperor
  With rubies pelteth me;

Or gold, who am the Prince of Mines;
  Or diamonds, when I see
A diadem to fit a dome
  Continual crowning me.





II.

SUPERIORITY TO FATE.

Superiority to fate
  Is difficult to learn.
'T is not conferred by any,
  But possible to earn

A pittance at a time,
  Until, to her surprise,
The soul with strict economy
  Subsists till Paradise.





III.

HOPE.

Hope is a subtle glutton;
  He feeds upon the fair;
And yet, inspected closely,
  What abstinence is there!

His is the halcyon table
  That never seats but one,
And whatsoever is consumed
  The same amounts remain.





IV.

FORBIDDEN FRUIT.

I.

Forbidden fruit a flavor has
  That lawful orchards mocks;
How luscious lies the pea within
  The pod that Duty locks!





V.

FORBIDDEN FRUIT.

II.

Heaven is what I cannot reach!
  The apple on the tree,
Provided it do hopeless hang,
  That 'heaven' is, to me.

The color on the cruising cloud,
  The interdicted ground
Behind the hill, the house behind, --
  There Paradise is found!





VI.

A WORD.

A word is dead
When it is said,
  Some say.
I say it just
Begins to live
  That day.





VII.

To venerate the simple days
  Which lead the seasons by,
Needs but to remember
  That from you or me
They may take the trifle
  Termed mortality!

To invest existence with a stately air,
Needs but to remember
  That the acorn there
Is the egg of forests
  For the upper air!





VIII.

LIFE'S TRADES.

It's such a little thing to weep,
  So short a thing to sigh;
And yet by trades the size of these
  We men and women die!





IX.

Drowning is not so pitiful
  As the attempt to rise.
Three times, 't is said, a sinking man
  Comes up to face the skies,
And then declines forever
  To that abhorred abode
Where hope and he part company, --
  For he is grasped of God.
The Maker's cordial visage,
  However good to see,
Is shunned, we must admit it,
  Like an adversity.





X.

How still the bells in steeples stand,
  Till, swollen with the sky,
They leap upon their silver feet
  In frantic melody!





XI.

If the foolish call them 'flowers,'
  Need the wiser tell?
If the savans 'classify' them,
  It is just as well!

Those who read the Revelations
  Must not criticise
Those who read the same edition
  With beclouded eyes!

Could we stand with that old Moses
  Canaan denied, --
Scan, like him, the stately landscape
  On the other side, --

Doubtless we should deem superfluous
  Many sciences
Not pursued by learnèd angels
  In scholastic skies!

Low amid that glad _Belles lettres_
  Grant that we may stand,
Stars, amid profound Galaxies,
  At that grand 'Right hand'!





XII.

A SYLLABLE.

Could mortal lip divine
  The undeveloped freight
Of a delivered syllable,
  'T would crumble with the weight.





XIII.

PARTING.

My life closed twice before its close;
  It yet remains to see
If Immortality unveil
  A third event to me,

So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
  As these that twice befell.
Parting is all we know of heaven,
  And all we need of hell.





XIV.

ASPIRATION.

We never know how high we are
  Till we are called to rise;
And then, if we are true to plan,
  Our statures touch the skies.

The heroism we recite
  Would be a daily thing,
Did not ourselves the cubits warp
  For fear to be a king.





XV.

THE INEVITABLE.

While I was fearing it, it came,
  But came with less of fear,
Because that fearing it so long
  Had almost made it dear.
There is a fitting a dismay,
  A fitting a despair.
'Tis harder knowing it is due,
  Than knowing it is here.
The trying on the utmost,
  The morning it is new,
Is terribler than wearing it
  A whole existence through.





XVI.

A BOOK.

There is no frigate like a book
  To take us lands away,
Nor any coursers like a page
  Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take
  Without oppress of toll;
How frugal is the chariot
  That bears a human soul!





XVII.

Who has not found the heaven below
  Will fail of it above.
God's residence is next to mine,
  His furniture is love.





XVIII.

A PORTRAIT.

A face devoid of love or grace,
  A hateful, hard, successful face,
A face with which a stone
  Would feel as thoroughly at ease
As were they old acquaintances, --
  First time together thrown.





XIX.

I HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.

I had a guinea golden;
  I lost it in the sand,
And though the sum was simple,
  And pounds were in the land,
Still had it such a value
  Unto my frugal eye,
That when I could not find it
  I sat me down to sigh.

I had a crimson robin
  Who sang full many a day,
But when the woods were painted
  He, too, did fly away.
Time brought me other robins, --
  Their ballads were the same, --
Still for my missing troubadour
  I kept the 'house at hame.'

I had a star in heaven;
  One Pleiad was its name,
And when I was not heeding
  It wandered from the same.
And though the skies are crowded,
  And all the night ashine,
I do not care about it,
  Since none of them are mine.

My story has a moral:
  I have a missing friend, --
Pleiad its name, and robin,
  And guinea in the sand, --
And when this mournful ditty,
  Accompanied with tear,
Shall meet the eye of traitor
  In country far from here,
Grant that repentance solemn
  May seize upon his mind,
And he no consolation
  Beneath the sun may find.

NOTE. -- This poem may have had, like many others, a
personal origin. It is more than probable that it was
sent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty
reminder of letter-writing delinquencies.





XX.

SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

From all the jails the boys and girls
  Ecstatically leap, --
Beloved, only afternoon
  That prison doesn't keep.

They storm the earth and stun the air,
  A mob of solid bliss.
Alas! that frowns could lie in wait
  For such a foe as this!






XXI.

Few get enough, -- enough is one;
  To that ethereal throng
Have not each one of us the right
  To stealthily belong?





XXII.

Upon the gallows hung a wretch,
  Too sullied for the hell
To which the law entitled him.
  As nature's curtain fell
The one who bore him tottered in,
  For this was woman's son.
''T was all I had,' she stricken gasped;
  Oh, what a livid boon!





XXIII.

THE LOST THOUGHT.

I felt a clearing in my mind
  As if my brain had split;
I tried to match it, seam by seam,
  But could not make them fit.

The thought behind I strove to join
  Unto the thought before,
But sequence ravelled out of reach
  Like balls upon a floor.





XXIV.

RETICENCE.

The reticent volcano keeps
  His never slumbering plan;
Confided are his projects pink
  To no precarious man.

If nature will not tell the tale
  Jehovah told to her,
Can human nature not survive
  Without a listener?

Admonished by her buckled lips
  Let every babbler be.
The only secret people keep
  Is Immortality.





XXV.

WITH FLOWERS.

If recollecting were forgetting,
  Then I remember not;
And if forgetting, recollecting,
  How near I had forgot!
And if to miss were merry,
  And if to mourn were gay,
How very blithe the fingers
  That gathered these to-day!





XXVI.

The farthest thunder that I heard
  Was nearer than the sky,
And rumbles still, though torrid noons
  Have lain their missiles by.
The lightning that preceded it
  Struck no one but myself,
But I would not exchange the bolt
  For all the rest of life.
Indebtedness to oxygen
  The chemist may repay,
But not the obligation
  To electricity.
It founds the homes and decks the days,
  And every clamor bright
Is but the gleam concomitant
  Of that waylaying light.
The thought is quiet as a flake, --
  A crash without a sound;
How life's reverberation
  Its explanation found!





XXVII.

On the bleakness of my lot
  Bloom I strove to raise.
Late, my acre of a rock
  Yielded grape and maize.

Soil of flint if steadfast tilled
  Will reward the hand;
Seed of palm by Lybian sun
  Fructified in sand.





XXVIII.

CONTRAST.

A door just opened on a street --
  I, lost, was passing by --
An instant's width of warmth disclosed,
  And wealth, and company.

The door as sudden shut, and I,
  I, lost, was passing by, --
Lost doubly, but by contrast most,
  Enlightening misery.






XXIX.

FRIENDS.

Are friends delight or pain?
  Could bounty but remain
Riches were good.

But if they only stay
Bolder to fly away,
  Riches are sad.






XXX.

FIRE.

Ashes denote that fire was;
  Respect the grayest pile
For the departed creature's sake
  That hovered there awhile.

Fire exists the first in light,
  And then consolidates, --
Only the chemist can disclose
  Into what carbonates.





XXXI.

A MAN.

Fate slew him, but he did not drop;
  She felled -- he did not fall --
Impaled him on her fiercest stakes --
  He neutralized them all.

She stung him, sapped his firm advance,
  But, when her worst was done,
And he, unmoved, regarded her,
  Acknowledged him a man.





XXXII.

VENTURES.

Finite to fail, but infinite to venture.
  For the one ship that struts the shore
Many's the gallant, overwhelmed creature
  Nodding in navies nevermore.





XXXIII.

GRIEFS.

I measure every grief I meet
  With analytic eyes;
I wonder if it weighs like mine,
  Or has an easier size.

I wonder if they bore it long,
  Or did it just begin?
I could not tell the date of mine,
  It feels so old a pain.

I wonder if it hurts to live,
  And if they have to try,
And whether, could they choose between,
  They would not rather die.

I wonder if when years have piled --
  Some thousands -- on the cause
Of early hurt, if such a lapse
  Could give them any pause;

Or would they go on aching still
  Through centuries above,
Enlightened to a larger pain
  By contrast with the love.

The grieved are many, I am told;
  The reason deeper lies, --
Death is but one and comes but once,
  And only nails the eyes.

There's grief of want, and grief of cold, --
  A sort they call 'despair;'
There's banishment from native eyes,
  In sight of native air.

And though I may not guess the kind
  Correctly, yet to me
A piercing comfort it affords
  In passing Calvary,

To note the fashions of the cross,
  Of those that stand alone,
Still fascinated to presume
  That some are like my own.





XXXIV.

I have a king who does not speak;
So, wondering, thro' the hours meek
  I trudge the day away,--
Half glad when it is night and sleep,
If, haply, thro' a dream to peep
  In parlors shut by day.

And if I do, when morning comes,
It is as if a hundred drums
  Did round my pillow roll,
And shouts fill all my childish sky,
And bells keep saying 'victory'
  From steeples in my soul!

And if I don't, the little Bird
Within the Orchard is not heard,
  And I omit to pray,
'Father, thy will be done' to-day,
For my will goes the other way,
  And it were perjury!





XXXV.

DISENCHANTMENT.

It dropped so low in my regard
  I heard it hit the ground,
And go to pieces on the stones
  At bottom of my mind;

Yet blamed the fate that fractured, less
  Than I reviled myself
For entertaining plated wares
  Upon my silver shelf.





XXXVI.

LOST FAITH.

To lose one's faith surpasses
  The loss of an estate,
Because estates can be
  Replenished, -- faith cannot.

Inherited with life,
  Belief but once can be;
Annihilate a single clause,
  And Being's beggary.





XXXVII.

LOST JOY.

I had a daily bliss
  I half indifferent viewed,
Till sudden I perceived it stir, --
  It grew as I pursued,

Till when, around a crag,
  It wasted from my sight,
Enlarged beyond my utmost scope,
  I learned its sweetness right.





XXXVIII.

I worked for chaff, and earning wheat
  Was haughty and betrayed.
What right had fields to arbitrate
  In matters ratified?

I tasted wheat, -- and hated chaff,
  And thanked the ample friend;
Wisdom is more becoming viewed
  At distance than at hand.





XXXIX.

Life, and Death, and Giants
  Such as these, are still.
Minor apparatus, hopper of the mill,
Beetle at the candle,
  Or a fife's small fame,
Maintain by accident
  That they proclaim.





XL.

ALPINE GLOW.

Our lives are Swiss, --
  So still, so cool,
  Till, some odd afternoon,
The Alps neglect their curtains,
  And we look farther on.

Italy stands the other side,
  While, like a guard between,
The solemn Alps,
The siren Alps,
  Forever intervene!





XLI.

REMEMBRANCE.

Remembrance has a rear and front, --
  'T is something like a house;
It has a garret also
  For refuse and the mouse,

Besides, the deepest cellar
  That ever mason hewed;
Look to it, by its fathoms
  Ourselves be not pursued.





XLII.

To hang our head ostensibly,
  And subsequent to find
That such was not the posture
  Of our immortal mind,

Affords the sly presumption
  That, in so dense a fuzz,
You, too, take cobweb attitudes
  Upon a plane of gauze!





XLIII.

THE BRAIN.

The brain is wider than the sky,
  For, put them side by side,
The one the other will include
  With ease, and you beside.

The brain is deeper than the sea,
  For, hold them, blue to blue,
The one the other will absorb,
  As sponges, buckets do.

The brain is just the weight of God,
  For, lift them, pound for pound,
And they will differ, if they do,
  As syllable from sound.





XLIV.

The bone that has no marrow;
  What ultimate for that?
It is not fit for table,
  For beggar, or for cat.

A bone has obligations,
  A being has the same;
A marrowless assembly
  Is culpabler than shame.

But how shall finished creatures
  A function fresh obtain? --
Old Nicodemus' phantom
  Confronting us again!





XLV.

THE PAST.

The past is such a curious creature,
  To look her in the face
A transport may reward us,
  Or a disgrace.

Unarmed if any meet her,
  I charge him, fly!
Her rusty ammunition
  Might yet reply!





XLVI.

To help our bleaker parts
  Salubrious hours are given,
Which if they do not fit for earth
  Drill silently for heaven.





XLVII.

What soft, cherubic creatures
  These gentlewomen are!
One would as soon assault a plush
  Or violate a star.

Such dimity convictions,
  A horror so refined
Of freckled human nature,
  Of Deity ashamed, --

It's such a common glory,
  A fisherman's degree!
Redemption, brittle lady,
  Be so, ashamed of thee.





XLVIII.

DESIRE.

Who never wanted, -- maddest joy
  Remains to him unknown:
The banquet of abstemiousness
  Surpasses that of wine.

Within its hope, though yet ungrasped
  Desire's perfect goal,
No nearer, lest reality
  Should disenthrall thy soul.





XLIX.

PHILOSOPHY.

It might be easier
  To fail with land in sight,
Than gain my blue peninsula
  To perish of delight.





L.

POWER.

You cannot put a fire out;
  A thing that can ignite
Can go, itself, without a fan
  Upon the slowest night.

You cannot fold a flood
  And put it in a drawer, --
Because the winds would find it out,
  And tell your cedar floor.





LI.

A modest lot, a fame petite,
  A brief campaign of sting and sweet
  Is plenty! Is enough!
A sailor's business is the shore,
  A soldier's -- balls. Who asketh more
Must seek the neighboring life!





LII.

Is bliss, then, such abyss
I must not put my foot amiss
For fear I spoil my shoe?

I'd rather suit my foot
Than save my boot,
For yet to buy another pair
Is possible
At any fair.

But bliss is sold just once;
The patent lost
None buy it any more.





LIII.

EXPERIENCE.

I stepped from plank to plank
  So slow and cautiously;
The stars about my head I felt,
  About my feet the sea.

I knew not but the next
  Would be my final inch, --
This gave me that precarious gait
  Some call experience.





LIV.

THANKSGIVING DAY.

One day is there of the series
  Termed Thanksgiving day,
Celebrated part at table,
  Part in memory.

Neither patriarch nor pussy,
  I dissect the play;
Seems it, to my hooded thinking,
  Reflex holiday.

Had there been no sharp subtraction
  From the early sum,
Not an acre or a caption
  Where was once a room,

Not a mention, whose small pebble
  Wrinkled any bay, --
Unto such, were such assembly,
  'T were Thanksgiving day.





LV.

CHILDISH GRIEFS.

Softened by Time's consummate plush,
  How sleek the woe appears
That threatened childhood's citadel
  And undermined the years!

Bisected now by bleaker griefs,
  We envy the despair
That devastated childhood's realm,
  So easy to repair.






II. LOVE.


I.

CONSECRATION.

Proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,
  Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,
Proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,
  Not to partake thy passion, my humility.





II.

LOVE'S HUMILITY.

My worthiness is all my doubt,
  His merit all my fear,
Contrasting which, my qualities
  Do lowlier appear;

Lest I should insufficient prove
  For his beloved need,
The chiefest apprehension
  Within my loving creed.

So I, the undivine abode
  Of his elect content,
Conform my soul as 't were a church
  Unto her sacrament.





III.

LOVE.

Love is anterior to life,
  Posterior to death,
Initial of creation, and
  The exponent of breath.





IV.

SATISFIED.

One blessing had I, than the rest
  So larger to my eyes
That I stopped gauging, satisfied,
  For this enchanted size.

It was the limit of my dream,
  The focus of my prayer, --
A perfect, paralyzing bliss
  Contented as despair.

I knew no more of want or cold,
  Phantasms both become,
For this new value in the soul,
  Supremest earthly sum.

The heaven below the heaven above
  Obscured with ruddier hue.
Life's latitude leant over-full;
  The judgment perished, too.

Why joys so scantily disburse,
  Why Paradise defer,
Why floods are served to us in bowls, --
  I speculate no more.





V.

WITH A FLOWER.

When roses cease to bloom, dear,
  And violets are done,
When bumble-bees in solemn flight
  Have passed beyond the sun,

The hand that paused to gather
  Upon this summer's day
Will idle lie, in Auburn, --
  Then take my flower, pray!





VI.

SONG.

Summer for thee grant I may be
  When summer days are flown!
Thy music still when whippoorwill
  And oriole are done!

For thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb
  And sow my blossoms o'er!
Pray gather me, Anemone,
  Thy flower forevermore!





VII.

LOYALTY.

Split the lark and you'll find the music,
  Bulb after bulb, in silver rolled,
Scantily dealt to the summer morning,
  Saved for your ear when lutes be old.

Loose the flood, you shall find it patent,
  Gush after gush, reserved for you;
Scarlet experiment! sceptic Thomas,
  Now, do you doubt that your bird was true?





VIII.

To lose thee, sweeter than to gain
  All other hearts I knew.
'T is true the drought is destitute,
  But then I had the dew!

The Caspian has its realms of sand,
  Its other realm of sea;
Without the sterile perquisite
  No Caspian could be.





IX.

  Poor little heart!
  Did they forget thee?
Then dinna care! Then dinna care!

  Proud little heart!
  Did they forsake thee?
Be debonair! Be debonair!

  Frail little heart!
  I would not break thee:
Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me?

  Gay little heart!
  Like morning glory
Thou'll wilted be; thou'll wilted be!





X.

FORGOTTEN.

There is a word
  Which bears a sword
  Can pierce an armed man.
It hurls its barbed syllables,--
  At once is mute again.
But where it fell
The saved will tell
  On patriotic day,
Some epauletted brother
  Gave his breath away.

Wherever runs the breathless sun,
  Wherever roams the day,
There is its noiseless onset,
  There is its victory!

Behold the keenest marksman!
  The most accomplished shot!
Time's sublimest target
  Is a soul 'forgot'!





XI.

I've got an arrow here;
  Loving the hand that sent it,
I the dart revere.

Fell, they will say, in 'skirmish'!
  Vanquished, my soul will know,
By but a simple arrow
  Sped by an archer's bow.





XII.

THE MASTER.

He fumbles at your spirit
  As players at the keys
Before they drop full music on;
  He stuns you by degrees,

Prepares your brittle substance
  For the ethereal blow,
By fainter hammers, further heard,
  Then nearer, then so slow

Your breath has time to straighten,
  Your brain to bubble cool, --
Deals one imperial thunderbolt
  That scalps your naked soul.





XIII.

Heart, we will forget him!
  You and I, to-night!
You may forget the warmth he gave,
  I will forget the light.

When you have done, pray tell me,
  That I my thoughts may dim;
Haste! lest while you're lagging,
  I may remember him!





XIV.

Father, I bring thee not myself, --
  That were the little load;
I bring thee the imperial heart
  I had not strength to hold.

The heart I cherished in my own
  Till mine too heavy grew,
Yet strangest, heavier since it went,
  Is it too large for you?





XV.

We outgrow love like other things
  And put it in the drawer,
Till it an antique fashion shows
  Like costumes grandsires wore.





XVI.

Not with a club the heart is broken,
    Nor with a stone;
A whip, so small you could not see it.
    I've known

To lash the magic creature
    Till it fell,
Yet that whip's name too noble
    Then to tell.

Magnanimous of bird
    By boy descried,
To sing unto the stone
    Of which it died.





XVII.

WHO?

My friend must be a bird,
    Because it flies!
Mortal my friend must be,
    Because it dies!
Barbs has it, like a bee.
Ah, curious friend,
    Thou puzzlest me!





XVIII.

He touched me, so I live to know
That such a day, permitted so,
  I groped upon his breast.
It was a boundless place to me,
And silenced, as the awful sea
  Puts minor streams to rest.

And now, I'm different from before,
As if I breathed superior air,
  Or brushed a royal gown;
My feet, too, that had wandered so,
My gypsy face transfigured now
  To tenderer renown.





XIX.

DREAMS.

Let me not mar that perfect dream
  By an auroral stain,
But so adjust my daily night
  That it will come again.





XX.

NUMEN LUMEN.

I live with him, I see his face;
  I go no more away
For visitor, or sundown;
  Death's single privacy,

The only one forestalling mine,
  And that by right that he
Presents a claim invisible,
  No wedlock granted me.

I live with him, I hear his voice,
  I stand alive to-day
To witness to the certainty
  Of immortality

Taught me by Time, -- the lower way,
  Conviction every day, --
That life like this is endless,
  Be judgment what it may.





XXI.

LONGING.

I envy seas whereon he rides,
  I envy spokes of wheels
Of chariots that him convey,
  I envy speechless hills

That gaze upon his journey;
  How easy all can see
What is forbidden utterly
  As heaven, unto me!

I envy nests of sparrows
  That dot his distant eaves,
The wealthy fly upon his pane,
  The happy, happy leaves

That just abroad his window
  Have summer's leave to be,
The earrings of Pizarro
  Could not obtain for me.

I envy light that wakes him,
  And bells that boldly ring
To tell him it is noon abroad, --
  Myself his noon could bring,

Yet interdict my blossom
  And abrogate my bee,
Lest noon in everlasting night
  Drop Gabriel and me.





XXII.

WEDDED.

A solemn thing it was, I said,
  A woman white to be,
And wear, if God should count me fit,
  Her hallowed mystery.

A timid thing to drop a life
  Into the purple well,
Too plummetless that it come back
  Eternity until.









III. NATURE.


I.

NATURE'S CHANGES.

The springtime's pallid landscape
  Will glow like bright bouquet,
Though drifted deep in parian
  The village lies to-day.

The lilacs, bending many a year,
  With purple load will hang;
The bees will not forget the tune
  Their old forefathers sang.

The rose will redden in the bog,
  The aster on the hill
Her everlasting fashion set,
  And covenant gentians frill,

Till summer folds her miracle
  As women do their gown,
Or priests adjust the symbols
  When sacrament is done.





II.

THE TULIP.

She slept beneath a tree
  Remembered but by me.
I touched her cradle mute;
She recognized the foot,
Put on her carmine suit, --
  And see!





III.

A light exists in spring
  Not present on the year
At any other period.
  When March is scarcely here

A color stands abroad
  On solitary hills
That science cannot overtake,
  But human nature feels.

It waits upon the lawn;
  It shows the furthest tree
Upon the furthest slope we know;
  It almost speaks to me.

Then, as horizons step,
  Or noons report away,
Without the formula of sound,
  It passes, and we stay:

A quality of loss
  Affecting our content,
As trade had suddenly encroached
  Upon a sacrament.





IV.

THE WAKING YEAR.

A lady red upon the hill
  Her annual secret keeps;
A lady white within the field
  In placid lily sleeps!

The tidy breezes with their brooms
  Sweep vale, and hill, and tree!
Prithee, my pretty housewives!
  Who may expected be?

The neighbors do not yet suspect!
  The woods exchange a smile --
Orchard, and buttercup, and bird --
  In such a little while!

And yet how still the landscape stands,
  How nonchalant the wood,
As if the resurrection
  Were nothing very odd!





V.

TO MARCH.

Dear March, come in!
How glad I am!
I looked for you before.
Put down your hat --
You must have walked --
How out of breath you are!
Dear March, how are you?
And the rest?
Did you leave Nature well?
Oh, March, come right upstairs with me,
I have so much to tell!

I got your letter, and the birds';
The maples never knew
That you were coming, -- I declare,
How red their faces grew!
But, March, forgive me --
And all those hills
You left for me to hue;
There was no purple suitable,
You took it all with you.

Who knocks? That April!
Lock the door!
I will not be pursued!
He stayed away a year, to call
When I am occupied.
But trifles look so trivial
As soon as you have come,
That blame is just as dear as praise
And praise as mere as blame.





VI.

MARCH.

We like March, his shoes are purple,
  He is new and high;
Makes he mud for dog and peddler,
  Makes he forest dry;
Knows the adder's tongue his coming,
  And begets her spot.
Stands the sun so close and mighty
  That our minds are hot.
News is he of all the others;
  Bold it were to die
With the blue-birds buccaneering
  On his British sky.




VII.

DAWN.

Not knowing when the dawn will come
  I open every door;
Or has it feathers like a bird,
  Or billows like a shore?





VIII.

A murmur in the trees to note,
  Not loud enough for wind;
A star not far enough to seek,
  Nor near enough to find;

A long, long yellow on the lawn,
  A hubbub as of feet;
Not audible, as ours to us,
  But dapperer, more sweet;

A hurrying home of little men
  To houses unperceived, --
All this, and more, if I should tell,
  Would never be believed.

Of robins in the trundle bed
  How many I espy
Whose nightgowns could not hide the wings,
  Although I heard them try!

But then I promised ne'er to tell;
  How could I break my word?
So go your way and I'll go mine, --
  No fear you'll miss the road.





IX.

Morning is the place for dew,
  Corn is made at noon,
After dinner light for flowers,
  Dukes for setting sun!





X.

To my quick ear the leaves conferred;
  The bushes they were bells;
I could not find a privacy
  From Nature's sentinels.

In cave if I presumed to hide,
  The walls began to tell;
Creation seemed a mighty crack
  To make me visible.





XI.

A ROSE.

A sepal, petal, and a thorn
  Upon a common summer's morn,
A flash of dew, a bee or two,
A breeze
A caper in the trees, --
  And I'm a rose!





XII.

High from the earth I heard a bird;
  He trod upon the trees
As he esteemed them trifles,
  And then he spied a breeze,
And situated softly
  Upon a pile of wind
Which in a perturbation
  Nature had left behind.
A joyous-going fellow
  I gathered from his talk,
Which both of benediction
  And badinage partook,
Without apparent burden,
  I learned, in leafy wood
He was the faithful father
  Of a dependent brood;
And this untoward transport
  His remedy for care, --
A contrast to our respites.
  How different we are!





XIII.

COBWEBS.

The spider as an artist
  Has never been employed
Though his surpassing merit
  Is freely certified

By every broom and Bridget
  Throughout a Christian land.
Neglected son of genius,
  I take thee by the hand.





XIV.

A WELL.

What mystery pervades a well!
  The water lives so far,
Like neighbor from another world
  Residing in a jar.

The grass does not appear afraid;
  I often wonder he
Can stand so close and look so bold
  At what is dread to me.

Related somehow they may be, --
  The sedge stands next the sea,
Where he is floorless, yet of fear
  No evidence gives he.

But nature is a stranger yet;
  The ones that cite her most
Have never passed her haunted house,
  Nor simplified her ghost.

To pity those that know her not
  Is helped by the regret
That those who know her, know her less
  The nearer her they get.





XV.

To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, --
One clover, and a bee,
And revery.
The revery alone will do
If bees are few.





XVI.

THE WIND.

It's like the light, --
  A fashionless delight
It's like the bee, --
  A dateless melody.

It's like the woods,
  Private like breeze,
Phraseless, yet it stirs
  The proudest trees.

It's like the morning, --
  Best when it's done, --
The everlasting clocks
  Chime noon.





XVII.

A dew sufficed itself
  And satisfied a leaf,
And felt, 'how vast a destiny!
  How trivial is life!'

The sun went out to work,
  The day went out to play,
But not again that dew was seen
  By physiognomy.

Whether by day abducted,
  Or emptied by the sun
Into the sea, in passing,
  Eternally unknown.





XVIII.

THE WOODPECKER.

His bill an auger is,
  His head, a cap and frill.
He laboreth at every tree, --
  A worm his utmost goal.





XIX.

A SNAKE.

Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
  Until we meet a snake;
'T is then we sigh for houses,
  And our departure take
At that enthralling gallop
  That only childhood knows.
A snake is summer's treason,
  And guile is where it goes.





XX.

Could I but ride indefinite,
  As doth the meadow-bee,
And visit only where I liked,
  And no man visit me,

And flirt all day with buttercups,
  And marry whom I may,
And dwell a little everywhere,
  Or better, run away

With no police to follow,
  Or chase me if I do,
Till I should jump peninsulas
  To get away from you, --

I said, but just to be a bee
  Upon a raft of air,
And row in nowhere all day long,
  And anchor off the bar,--
What liberty! So captives deem
  Who tight in dungeons are.





XXI.

THE MOON.

The moon was but a chin of gold
  A night or two ago,
And now she turns her perfect face
  Upon the world below.

Her forehead is of amplest blond;
  Her cheek like beryl stone;
Her eye unto the summer dew
  The likest I have known.

Her lips of amber never part;
  But what must be the smile
Upon her friend she could bestow
  Were such her silver will!

And what a privilege to be
  But the remotest star!
For certainly her way might pass
  Beside your twinkling door.

Her bonnet is the firmament,
  The universe her shoe,
The stars the trinkets at her belt,
  Her dimities of blue.





XXII.

THE BAT.

The bat is dun with wrinkled wings
  Like fallow article,
And not a song pervades his lips,
  Or none perceptible.

His small umbrella, quaintly halved,
  Describing in the air
An arc alike inscrutable, --
  Elate philosopher!

Deputed from what firmament
  Of what astute abode,
Empowered with what malevolence
  Auspiciously withheld.

To his adroit Creator
  Ascribe no less the praise;
Beneficent, believe me,
  His eccentricities.





XXIII.

THE BALLOON.

You've seen balloons set, haven't you?
  So stately they ascend
It is as swans discarded you
  For duties diamond.

Their liquid feet go softly out
  Upon a sea of blond;
They spurn the air as 't were too mean
  For creatures so renowned.

Their ribbons just beyond the eye,
  They struggle some for breath,
And yet the crowd applauds below;
  They would not encore death.

The gilded creature strains and spins,
  Trips frantic in a tree,
Tears open her imperial veins
  And tumbles in the sea.

The crowd retire with an oath
  The dust in streets goes down,
And clerks in counting-rooms observe,
  ''T was only a balloon.'





XXIV.

EVENING.

The cricket sang,
And set the sun,
And workmen finished, one by one,
  Their seam the day upon.

The low grass loaded with the dew,
The twilight stood as strangers do
With hat in hand, polite and new,
  To stay as if, or go.

A vastness, as a neighbor, came, --
A wisdom without face or name,
A peace, as hemispheres at home, --
  And so the night became.





XXV.

COCOON.

Drab habitation of whom?
Tabernacle or tomb,
Or dome of worm,
Or porch of gnome,
Or some elf's catacomb?




XXVI.

SUNSET.

A sloop of amber slips away
  Upon an ether sea,
And wrecks in peace a purple tar,
  The son of ecstasy.





XXVII.

AURORA.

Of bronze and blaze
  The north, to-night!
  So adequate its forms,
So preconcerted with itself,
  So distant to alarms, --
An unconcern so sovereign
  To universe, or me,
It paints my simple spirit
  With tints of majesty,
Till I take vaster attitudes,
  And strut upon my stem,
Disdaining men and oxygen,
  For arrogance of them.

My splendors are menagerie;
  But their competeless show
Will entertain the centuries
  When I am, long ago,
An island in dishonored grass,
  Whom none but daisies know.





XXVIII.

THE COMING OF NIGHT.

How the old mountains drip with sunset,
  And the brake of dun!
How the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel
  By the wizard sun!

How the old steeples hand the scarlet,
  Till the ball is full, --
Have I the lip of the flamingo
  That I dare to tell?

Then, how the fire ebbs like billows,
  Touching all the grass
With a departing, sapphire feature,
  As if a duchess pass!

How a small dusk crawls on the village
  Till the houses blot;
And the odd flambeaux no men carry
  Glimmer on the spot!

Now it is night in nest and kennel,
  And where was the wood,
Just a dome of abyss is nodding
  Into solitude! --

These are the visions baffled Guido;
  Titian never told;
Domenichino dropped the pencil,
  Powerless to unfold.





XXIX.

AFTERMATH.

The murmuring of bees has ceased;
  But murmuring of some
Posterior, prophetic,
  Has simultaneous come, --

The lower metres of the year,
  When nature's laugh is done, --
The Revelations of the book
  Whose Genesis is June.






IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.

I.

This world is not conclusion;
  A sequel stands beyond,
Invisible, as music,
  But positive, as sound.
It beckons and it baffles;
  Philosophies don't know,
And through a riddle, at the last,
  Sagacity must go.
To guess it puzzles scholars;
  To gain it, men have shown
Contempt of generations,
  And crucifixion known.





II.

We learn in the retreating
  How vast an one
Was recently among us.
  A perished sun

Endears in the departure
  How doubly more
Than all the golden presence
  It was before!





III.

They say that 'time assuages,' --
  Time never did assuage;
An actual suffering strengthens,
  As sinews do, with age.

Time is a test of trouble,
  But not a remedy.
If such it prove, it prove too
  There was no malady.





IV.

We cover thee, sweet face.
  Not that we tire of thee,
But that thyself fatigue of us;
  Remember, as thou flee,
We follow thee until
  Thou notice us no more,
And then, reluctant, turn away
  To con thee o'er and o'er,
And blame the scanty love
  We were content to show,
Augmented, sweet, a hundred fold
  If thou would'st take it now.





V.

ENDING.

That is solemn we have ended, --
  Be it but a play,
Or a glee among the garrets,
  Or a holiday,

Or a leaving home; or later,
  Parting with a world
We have understood, for better
  Still it be unfurled.





VI.

The stimulus, beyond the grave
  His countenance to see,
Supports me like imperial drams
  Afforded royally.





VII.

Given in marriage unto thee,
  Oh, thou celestial host!
Bride of the Father and the Son,
  Bride of the Holy Ghost!

Other betrothal shall dissolve,
  Wedlock of will decay;
Only the keeper of this seal
  Conquers mortality.






VIII.

That such have died enables us
  The tranquiller to die;
That such have lived, certificate
  For immortality.





IX.

They won't frown always, -- some sweet day
  When I forget to tease,
They'll recollect how cold I looked,
  And how I just said 'please.'

Then they will hasten to the door
  To call the little child,
Who cannot thank them, for the ice
  That on her lisping piled.





X.

IMMORTALITY.

It is an honorable thought,
  And makes one lift one's hat,
As one encountered gentlefolk
  Upon a daily street,

That we've immortal place,
  Though pyramids decay,
And kingdoms, like the orchard,
  Flit russetly away.





XI.

The distance that the dead have gone
  Does not at first appear;
Their coming back seems possible
  For many an ardent year.

And then, that we have followed them
  We more than half suspect,
So intimate have we become
  With their dear retrospect.





XII.

How dare the robins sing,
  When men and women hear
Who since they went to their account
  Have settled with the year! --
Paid all that life had earned
  In one consummate bill,
And now, what life or death can do
  Is immaterial.
Insulting is the sun
  To him whose mortal light,
Beguiled of immortality,
  Bequeaths him to the night.
In deference to him
  Extinct be every hum,
Whose garden wrestles with the dew,
  At daybreak overcome!





XIII.

DEATH.

Death is like the insect
  Menacing the tree,
Competent to kill it,
  But decoyed may be.

Bait it with the balsam,
  Seek it with the knife,
Baffle, if it cost you
  Everything in life.

Then, if it have burrowed
  Out of reach of skill,
Ring the tree and leave it, --
  'T is the vermin's will.





XIV.

UNWARNED.

'T is sunrise, little maid, hast thou
  No station in the day?
'T was not thy wont to hinder so, --
  Retrieve thine industry.

'T is noon, my little maid, alas!
  And art thou sleeping yet?
The lily waiting to be wed,
  The bee, dost thou forget?

My little maid, 't is night; alas,
  That night should be to thee
Instead of morning! Hadst thou broached
  Thy little plan to me,
Dissuade thee if I could not, sweet,
  I might have aided thee.





XV.

Each that we lose takes part of us;
  A crescent still abides,
Which like the moon, some turbid night,
  Is summoned by the tides.





XVI.

Not any higher stands the grave
  For heroes than for men;
Not any nearer for the child
  Than numb three-score and ten.

This latest leisure equal lulls
  The beggar and his queen;
Propitiate this democrat
  By summer's gracious mien.





XVII.

ASLEEP.

As far from pity as complaint,
  As cool to speech as stone,
As numb to revelation
  As if my trade were bone.

As far from time as history,
  As near yourself to-day
As children to the rainbow's scarf,
  Or sunset's yellow play

To eyelids in the sepulchre.
  How still the dancer lies,
While color's revelations break,
  And blaze the butterflies!





XVIII.

THE SPIRIT.

'T is whiter than an Indian pipe,
  'T is dimmer than a lace;
No stature has it, like a fog,
  When you approach the place.

Not any voice denotes it here,
  Or intimates it there;
A spirit, how doth it accost?
  What customs hath the air?

This limitless hyperbole
  Each one of us shall be;
'T is drama, if (hypothesis)
  It be not tragedy!





XIX.

THE MONUMENT.

She laid her docile crescent down,
  And this mechanic stone
Still states, to dates that have forgot,
  The news that she is gone.

So constant to its stolid trust,
  The shaft that never knew,
It shames the constancy that fled
  Before its emblem flew.





XX.

Bless God, he went as soldiers,
  His musket on his breast;
Grant, God, he charge the bravest
  Of all the martial blest.

Please God, might I behold him
  In epauletted white,
I should not fear the foe then,
  I should not fear the fight.





XXI.

Immortal is an ample word
  When what we need is by,
But when it leaves us for a time,
  'T is a necessity.

Of heaven above the firmest proof
  We fundamental know,
Except for its marauding hand,
  It had been heaven below.





XXII.

Where every bird is bold to go,
  And bees abashless play,
The foreigner before he knocks
  Must thrust the tears away.





XXIII.

The grave my little cottage is,
  Where, keeping house for thee,
I make my parlor orderly,
  And lay the marble tea,

For two divided, briefly,
  A cycle, it may be,
Till everlasting life unite
  In strong society.





XXIV.

This was in the white of the year,
  That was in the green,
Drifts were as difficult then to think
  As daisies now to be seen.

Looking back is best that is left,
  Or if it be before,
Retrospection is prospect's half,
  Sometimes almost more.





XXV.

Sweet hours have perished here;
  This is a mighty room;
Within its precincts hopes have played, --
  Now shadows in the tomb.





XXVI.

Me! Come! My dazzled face
In such a shining place!

Me! Hear! My foreign ear
The sounds of welcome near!

The saints shall meet
Our bashful feet.

My holiday shall be
That they remember me;

My paradise, the fame
That they pronounce my name.





XXVII.

INVISIBLE.

From us she wandered now a year,
  Her tarrying unknown;
If wilderness prevent her feet,
  Or that ethereal zone

No eye hath seen and lived,
  We ignorant must be.
We only know what time of year
  We took the mystery.






XXVIII.

I wish I knew that woman's name,
  So, when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears,
  For fear I hear her say

She's 'sorry I am dead,' again,
  Just when the grave and I
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, --
  Our only lullaby.





XXIX.

TRYING TO FORGET.

Bereaved of all, I went abroad,
  No less bereaved to be
Upon a new peninsula, --
  The grave preceded me,

Obtained my lodgings ere myself,
  And when I sought my bed,
The grave it was, reposed upon
  The pillow for my head.

I waked, to find it first awake,
  I rose, -- it followed me;
I tried to drop it in the crowd,
  To lose it in the sea,

In cups of artificial drowse
  To sleep its shape away, --
The grave was finished, but the spade
  Remained in memory.





XXX.

I felt a funeral in my brain,
  And mourners, to and fro,
Kept treading, treading, till it seemed
  That sense was breaking through.

And when they all were seated,
  A service like a drum
Kept beating, beating, till I thought
  My mind was going numb.

And then I heard them lift a box,
  And creak across my soul
With those same boots of lead, again.
  Then space began to toll

As all the heavens were a bell,
  And Being but an ear,
And I and silence some strange race,
  Wrecked, solitary, here.





XXXI.

I meant to find her when I came;
  Death had the same design;
But the success was his, it seems,
  And the discomfit mine.

I meant to tell her how I longed
  For just this single time;
But Death had told her so the first,
  And she had hearkened him.

To wander now is my abode;
  To rest, -- to rest would be
A privilege of hurricane
  To memory and me.





XXXII.

WAITING.

I sing to use the waiting,
  My bonnet but to tie,
And shut the door unto my house;
  No more to do have I,

Till, his best step approaching,
  We journey to the day,
And tell each other how we sang
  To keep the dark away.





XXXIII.

A sickness of this world it most occasions
  When best men die;
A wishfulness their far condition
  To occupy.

A chief indifference, as foreign
  A world must be
Themselves forsake contented,
  For Deity.





XXXIV.

Superfluous were the sun
  When excellence is dead;
He were superfluous every day,
  For every day is said

That syllable whose faith
  Just saves it from despair,
And whose 'I'll meet you' hesitates
  If love inquire, 'Where?'

Upon his dateless fame
  Our periods may lie,
As stars that drop anonymous
  From an abundant sky.





XXXV.

So proud she was to die
  It made us all ashamed
That what we cherished, so unknown
  To her desire seemed.

So satisfied to go
  Where none of us should be,
Immediately, that anguish stooped
  Almost to jealousy.





XXXVI.

FAREWELL.

Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,
  Then I am ready to go!
Just a look at the horses --
  Rapid! That will do!

Put me in on the firmest side,
  So I shall never fall;
For we must ride to the Judgment,
  And it's partly down hill.

But never I mind the bridges,
  And never I mind the sea;
Held fast in everlasting race
  By my own choice and thee.

Good-by to the life I used to live,
  And the world I used to know;
And kiss the hills for me, just once;
  Now I am ready to go!





XXXVII.

The dying need but little, dear, --
  A glass of water's all,
A flower's unobtrusive face
  To punctuate the wall,

A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,
  And certainly that one
No color in the rainbow
  Perceives when you are gone.





XXXVIII.

DEAD.

There's something quieter than sleep
  Within this inner room!
It wears a sprig upon its breast,
  And will not tell its name.

Some touch it and some kiss it,
  Some chafe its idle hand;
It has a simple gravity
  I do not understand!

While simple-hearted neighbors
  Chat of the 'early dead,'
We, prone to periphrasis,
  Remark that birds have fled!





XXXIX.

The soul should always stand ajar,
  That if the heaven inquire,
He will not be obliged to wait,
  Or shy of troubling her.

Depart, before the host has slid
  The bolt upon the door,
To seek for the accomplished guest, --
  Her visitor no more.





XL.

Three weeks passed since I had seen her, --
  Some disease had vexed;
'T was with text and village singing
  I beheld her next,

And a company -- our pleasure
  To discourse alone;
Gracious now to me as any,
  Gracious unto none.

Borne, without dissent of either,
  To the parish night;
Of the separated people
  Which are out of sight?





XLI.

I breathed enough to learn the trick,
  And now, removed from air,
I simulate the breath so well,
  That one, to be quite sure

The lungs are stirless, must descend
  Among the cunning cells,
And touch the pantomime himself.
  How cool the bellows feels!





XLII.

I wonder if the sepulchre
  Is not a lonesome way,
When men and boys, and larks and June
  Go down the fields to hay!





XLIII.

JOY IN DEATH.

If tolling bell I ask the cause.
  'A soul has gone to God,'
I'm answered in a lonesome tone;
  Is heaven then so sad?

That bells should joyful ring to tell
  A soul had gone to heaven,
Would seem to me the proper way
  A good news should be given.





XLIV.

If I may have it when it's dead
  I will contented be;
If just as soon as breath is out
  It shall belong to me,

Until they lock it in the grave,
  'T is bliss I cannot weigh,
For though they lock thee in the grave,
  Myself can hold the key.

Think of it, lover! I and thee
  Permitted face to face to be;
After a life, a death we'll say, --
  For death was that, and this is thee.





XLV.

Before the ice is in the pools,
  Before the skaters go,
Or any cheek at nightfall
  Is tarnished by the snow,

Before the fields have finished,
  Before the Christmas tree,
Wonder upon wonder
  Will arrive to me!

What we touch the hems of
  On a summer's day;
What is only walking
  Just a bridge away;

That which sings so, speaks so,
  When there's no one here, --
Will the frock I wept in
  Answer me to wear?





XLVI.

DYING.

I heard a fly buzz when I died;
  The stillness round my form
Was like the stillness in the air
  Between the heaves of storm.

The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
  And breaths were gathering sure
For that last onset, when the king
  Be witnessed in his power.

I willed my keepsakes, signed away
  What portion of me I
Could make assignable, -- and then
  There interposed a fly,

With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
  Between the light and me;
And then the windows failed, and then
  I could not see to see.





XLVII.

Adrift! A little boat adrift!
  And night is coming down!
Will no one guide a little boat
  Unto the nearest town?

So sailors say, on yesterday,
  Just as the dusk was brown,
One little boat gave up its strife,
  And gurgled down and down.

But angels say, on yesterday,
  Just as the dawn was red,
One little boat o'erspent with gales
Retrimmed its masts, redecked its sails
  Exultant, onward sped!





XLVIII.

There's been a death in the opposite house
  As lately as to-day.
I know it by the numb look
  Such houses have alway.

The neighbors rustle in and out,
  The doctor drives away.
A window opens like a pod,
  Abrupt, mechanically;

Somebody flings a mattress out, --
  The children hurry by;
They wonder if It died on that, --
  I used to when a boy.

The minister goes stiffly in
  As if the house were his,
And he owned all the mourners now,
  And little boys besides;

And then the milliner, and the man
  Of the appalling trade,
To take the measure of the house.
  There'll be that dark parade

Of tassels and of coaches soon;
  It's easy as a sign, --
The intuition of the news
  In just a country town.





XLIX.

We never know we go, -- when we are going
  We jest and shut the door;
Fate following behind us bolts it,
  And we accost no more.




L.

THE SOUL'S STORM.

It struck me every day
  The lightning was as new
As if the cloud that instant slit
  And let the fire through.

It burned me in the night,
  It blistered in my dream;
It sickened fresh upon my sight
  With every morning's beam.

I thought that storm was brief, --
  The maddest, quickest by;
But Nature lost the date of this,
  And left it in the sky.





LI.

Water is taught by thirst;
Land, by the oceans passed;
  Transport, by throe;
Peace, by its battles told;
Love, by memorial mould;
  Birds, by the snow.




LII.

THIRST.

We thirst at first, -- 't is Nature's act;
  And later, when we die,
A little water supplicate
  Of fingers going by.

It intimates the finer want,
  Whose adequate supply
Is that great water in the west
  Termed immortality.





LIII.

A clock stopped -- not the mantel's;
  Geneva's farthest skill
Can't put the puppet bowing
  That just now dangled still.

An awe came on the trinket!
  The figures hunched with pain,
Then quivered out of decimals
  Into degreeless noon.

It will not stir for doctors,
  This pendulum of snow;
The shopman importunes it,
  While cool, concernless No

Nods from the gilded pointers,
  Nods from the seconds slim,
Decades of arrogance between
  The dial life and him.





LIV.

CHARLOTTE BRONTË'S GRAVE.

All overgrown by cunning moss,
  All interspersed with weed,
The little cage of 'Currer Bell,'
  In quiet Haworth laid.

This bird, observing others,
  When frosts too sharp became,
Retire to other latitudes,
  Quietly did the same,

But differed in returning;
  Since Yorkshire hills are green,
Yet not in all the nests I meet
  Can nightingale be seen.

Gathered from many wanderings,
  Gethsemane can tell
Through what transporting anguish
  She reached the asphodel!

Soft fall the sounds of Eden
  Upon her puzzled ear;
Oh, what an afternoon for heaven,
  When 'Brontë' entered there!





LV.

A toad can die of light!
Death is the common right
  Of toads and men, --
Of earl and midge
The privilege.
  Why swagger then?
The gnat's supremacy
Is large as thine.





LVI.

Far from love the Heavenly Father
  Leads the chosen child;
Oftener through realm of briar
  Than the meadow mild,

Oftener by the claw of dragon
  Than the hand of friend,
Guides the little one predestined
  To the native land.





LVII.

SLEEPING.

A long, long sleep, a famous sleep
  That makes no show for dawn
By stretch of limb or stir of lid, --
  An independent one.

Was ever idleness like this?
  Within a hut of stone
To bask the centuries away
  Nor once look up for noon?





LVIII.

RETROSPECT.

'T was just this time last year I died.
  I know I heard the corn,
When I was carried by the farms, --
  It had the tassels on.

I thought how yellow it would look
  When Richard went to mill;
And then I wanted to get out,
  But something held my will.

I thought just how red apples wedged
  The stubble's joints between;
And carts went stooping round the fields
  To take the pumpkins in.

I wondered which would miss me least,
  And when Thanksgiving came,
If father'd multiply the plates
  To make an even sum.

And if my stocking hung too high,
  Would it blur the Christmas glee,
That not a Santa Claus could reach
  The altitude of me?

But this sort grieved myself, and so
  I thought how it would be
When just this time, some perfect year,
  Themselves should come to me.





LIX.

ETERNITY.

On this wondrous sea,
Sailing silently,
  Ho! pilot, ho!
Knowest thou the shore
Where no breakers roar,
  Where the storm is o'er?

In the silent west
Many sails at rest,
  Their anchors fast;
Thither I pilot thee, --
Land, ho! Eternity!
  Ashore at last!


    MY MOTHER'S KISS.

  My mother's kiss, my mother's kiss,
     I feel its impress now;
  As in the bright and happy days
     She pressed it on my brow.

  You say it is a fancied thing
     Within my memory fraught;
  To me it has a sacred place--
     The treasure house of thought.

  Again, I feel her fingers glide
     Amid my clustering hair;
  I see the love-light in her eyes,
     When all my life was fair.

  Again, I hear her gentle voice
     In warning or in love.
  How precious was the faith that taught
     My soul of things above.

  (1)


  2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.

  The music of her voice is stilled,
     Her lips are paled in death.
  As precious pearls I'll clasp her words
     Until my latest breath.

  The world has scattered round my path
     Honor and wealth and fame;
  But naught so precious as the thoughts
     That gather round her name.

  And friends have placed upon my brow
     The laurels of renown;
  But she first taught me how to wear
     My manhood as a crown.

  My hair is silvered o'er with age,
     I'm longing to depart;
  To clasp again my mother's hand,
     And be a child at heart.

  To roam with her the glory-land
     Where saints and angels greet;
  To cast our crowns with songs of love
     At our Redeemer's feet.


  A GRAIN OF SAND. 3

  A GRAIN OF SAND.

  Do you see this grain of sand
  Lying loosely in my hand?
  Do you know to me it brought
  Just a simple loving thought?
  When one gazes night by night
  On the glorious stars of light,
  Oh how little seems the span
  Measured round the life of man.

  Oh! how fleeting are his years
  With their smiles and their tears;
  Can it be that God does care
  For such atoms as we are?
  Then outspake this grain of sand
  "I was fashioned by His hand
  In the star lit realms of space
  I was made to have a place.

  "Should the ocean flood the world,
  Were its mountains 'gainst me hurled
  All the force they could employ
  Wouldn't a single grain destroy;
  And if I, a thing so light,
  Have a place within His sight;
  You are linked unto his throne
  Cannot live nor die alone.



  4 THE CROCUSES.

  In the everlasting arms
  Mid life's dangers and alarms
  Let calm trust your spirit fill;
  Know He's God, and then be still."
  Trustingly I raised my head
  Hearing what the atom said;
  Knowing man is greater far
  Than the brightest sun or star.


  THE CROCUSES.

  They heard the South wind sighing
     A murmur of the rain;
  And they knew that Earth was longing
     To see them all again.

  While the snow-drops still were sleeping
     Beneath the silent sod;
  They felt their new life pulsing
     Within the dark, cold clod.

  Not a daffodil nor daisy
     Had dared to raise its head;
  Not a fairhaired dandelion
     Peeped timid from its bed;


  THE CROCUSES.  5

  Though a tremor of the winter
     Did shivering through them run;
  Yet they lifted up their foreheads
     To greet the vernal sun.

  And the sunbeams gave them welcome.
     As did the morning air
  And scattered o'er their simple robes
     Rich tints of beauty rare.

  Soon a host of lovely flowers
     From vales and woodland burst;
  But in all that fair procession
     The crocuses were first.

  First to weave for Earth a chaplet
     To crown her dear old head;
  And to beautify the pathway
     Where winter still did tread.

  And their loved and white haired mother
     Smiled sweetly 'neath the touch,
  When she knew her faithful children
     Were loving her so much.


  6 THE PRESENT AGE.

  THE PRESENT AGE.

  Say not the age is hard and cold--
     I think it brave and grand;
  When men of diverse sects and creeds
     Are clasping hand in hand.

  The Parsee from his sacred fires
     Beside the Christian kneels;
  And clearer light to Islam's eyes
     The word of Christ reveals.

  The Brahmin from his distant home
     Brings thoughts of ancient lore;
  The Bhuddist breaking bonds of caste
     Divides mankind no more.

  The meek-eyed sons of far Cathay
     Are welcome round the board;
  Not greed, nor malice drives away
     These children of our Lord.

  And Judah from whose trusted hands
     Came oracles divine;
  Now sits with those around whose hearts
     The light of God doth shine.


  THE PRESENT AGE. 7

  Japan unbars her long sealed gates
     From islands far away;
  Her sons are lifting up their eyes
     To greet the coming day.

  The Indian child from forests wild
     Has learned to read and pray;
  The tomahawk and scalping knife
     From him have passed away.

  From centuries of servile toil
     The Negro finds release,
  And builds the fanes of prayer and praise
     Unto the God of Peace.

  England and Russia face to face
     With Central Asia meet;
  And on the far Pacific coast,
     Chinese and natives greet.

  Crusaders once with sword and shield
     The Holy Land to save;
  From Moslem hands did strive to clutch
     The dear Redeemer's grave.

  A battle greater, grander far
     Is for the present age;


  8 THE PRESENT AGE.

  A crusade for the rights of man
     To  brighten history's page.

  Where labor faints and bows her head,
     And want consorts with crime;
  Or men grown faithless sadly say
     That evil is the time.

  There is the field, the vantage ground
     For every earnest heart;
  To side with justice, truth and right
     And act a  noble part.

  To save from ignorance and vice
     The  poorest, humblest child;
  To make our age the fairest one
     On which the sun has smiled;

  To plant the roots of coming years
     In mercy, love and truth;
  And bid our weary, saddened earth
     Again renew her youth.

  Oh! earnest hearts! toil on in hope,
     'Till darkness shrinks from light;
  To fill the earth with peace and joy,
     Let youth and age unite:


  DEDICATION POEM. 9

  To stay the floods of sin and shame
     That sweep from shore to shore;
  And furl the banners stained with blood,
     'Till war shall be no more.

  Blame not the age, nor think it full
     Of evil and unrest;
  But say of every other age,
     "This one shall be the best."

  The age to brighten every path
     By sin and sorrow trod;
  For loving hearts to usher in
     The commonwealth of God.


  DEDICATION POEM.

       Dedication Poem on the reception of the annex to
  the home for aged colored people, from the bequest of
  Mr. Edward T. Parker.

  Outcast from her home in Syria
     In the lonely, dreary wild;
  Heavy hearted, sorrow stricken,
     Sat a mother and her child.


  10 DEDICATION POEM.

  There was not a voice to cheer her
     Not a soul to share her fate;
  She was weary, he was fainting,
     And life seemed so desolate.

  Far away in sunny Egypt
     Was lone Hagar's native land;
  Where the Nile in kingly bounty
     Scatters bread with gracious hand.

  In the tents of princely Abram
     She for years had found a home;
  Till the stern decree of Sarah
     Sent her forth the wild to roam.

  Hour by hour she journeyed onward
     From the shelter of their tent,
  Till her footsteps slowly faltered
     And the water all was spent;

  Then she veiled her face in sorrow,
     Feared her child would die of thirst
  Till  her eyes with tears so holden
     Saw a sparkling fountain burst.

  Oh! how happy was that mother,
     What a soothing of her pain;


  DEDICATION POEM.  11

  When she saw her child reviving,
     Life rejoicing through each vein

  Does not life repeat this story,
     Tell it over day by day?
  Of the fountains of refreshment
     Ever springing by our way.

  Here is one by which we gather,
     On this bright and happy day,
  Just to bask beside a fountain
     Making gladder life's highway.

  Bringing unto hearts now aged
     Who have borne life's burdens long,
  Such a gift of love and mercy
     As deserves our sweetest song.

  Such a gift that even heaven
     May rejoice with us below,
  If the pure and holy angels
     Join us in our joy and woe.

  May the memory of the giver
     In this home where age may rest,
  Float like fragrance through the ages,
     Ever blessing, ever blest.


  12 A DOUBLE STANDARD.

  When the gates of pearl are opened
     May we there this friend behold,
  Drink with him from living fountains,
     Walk with him the streets of gold.

  When life's shattered cords of music
     Shall again be sweetly sung;
  Then our hearts with life immortal,
     Shall be young, forever young.



  A DOUBLE STANDARD.

  Do you blame me that I loved him?
     If when standing all alone
  I cried for bread a careless world
     Pressed to my lips a stone.

  Do you blame me that I loved him,
     That my heart beat glad and free,
  When he told me in the sweetest tones
     He loved but only me?

  Can you blame me that I did not see
     Beneath his burning kiss
  The serpent's wiles, nor even hear
     The deadly adder hiss?


  A DOUBLE STANDARD. 13

  Can you blame me that my heart grew cold
     The tempted, tempter turned;
  When he was feted and caressed
     And I was coldly spurned?

  Would you blame him, when you draw from
        me
     Your dainty robes aside,
  If he with gilded baits should claim
     Your fairest as his bride?

  Would you blame the world if it should press
     On him a civic crown;
  And see me struggling in the depth
     Then harshly press me down?

  Crime has no sex and yet to-day
     I wear the brand of shame;
  Whilst he amid the gay and proud
     Still bears an honored name.

  Can you blame me if I've learned to think
     Your hate of vice a sham,
  When you so coldly crushed me down
     And then excused the man?

  Would you blame me if to-morrow
     The coroner should say,


  14 A DOUBLE STANDARD.

  A wretched girl, outcast, forlorn,
     Has thrown her life away?

  Yes, blame me for my downward course,
     But oh! remember well,
  Within your homes you press the hand
     That led me down to hell.

  I'm glad God's ways are not our ways
     He does not see as man;
  Within His love I know there's room
     For those whom others ban.

  I think before His great white throne,
     His throne of spotless light,
  That whited sepulchres shall wear
     The hue of endless night.

  That I who fell, and he who sinned,
     Shall reap as we have sown;
  That each the burden of his loss
     Must bear and bear alone.

  No golden weights can turn the scale
     Of justice in His sight;
  And what is wrong in woman's life
     In man's cannot be right.


  OUR HERO. 15

  OUR HERO.

  Onward to her destination,
     O'er the stream the Hannah sped,
  When a cry of consternation
     Smote and chilled our hearts with dread.

  Wildly leaping, madly sweeping,
     All relentless in their sway,
  Like a band of cruel demons
     Flames were closing 'round our way

  Oh! the horror of those moments;
     Flames above and waves below--
  Oh! the agony of ages
     Crowded in one hour of woe.

  Fainter grew our hearts with anguish
     In that hour with peril rife,
  When we saw the pilot flying,
     Terror-stricken, for his life.

  Then a man uprose before us--
     We had once despised his race--
  But we saw a lofty purpose
     Lighting up his darkened face.


  16 OUR HERO.

  While the flames were madly roaring,
     With a courage grand and high,
  Forth he rushed unto our rescue,
     Strong to suffer, brave to die.

  Helplessly the boat was drifting,
     Death was staring in each face,
  When he grasped the fallen rudder,
     Took the pilot's vacant place.

  Could he save us? Would he save us?
     All his hope of life give o'er?
  Could he hold that fated vessel
     'Till she reached the nearer shore?

  All our hopes and fears were centered
     'Round his strong, unfaltering hand;
  If he failed us we must perish,
     Perish just in sight of land.

  Breathlessly we watched and waited
     While the flames were raging fast;
  When our anguish changed to rapture--
     We were saved, yes, saved at last.

  Never strains of sweetest music
     Brought to us more welcome sound


  THE DYING BONDMAN. 17

  Than the grating of that steamer
     When her keel had touched the ground.

  But our faithful martyr hero
     Through a fiery pathway trod,
  Till he laid his valiant spirit
     On the bosom of his God.

  Fame has never crowned a hero
     On the crimson fields of strife,
  Grander, nobler, than that pilot
     Yielding up for us his life.



  THE DYING BONDMAN.

  Life was trembling, faintly trembling
  On the bondman's latest breath,
  And he felt the chilling pressure
  Of the cold, hard hand of Death.

  He had been an Afric chieftain,
  Worn his manhood as a crown;
  But upon the field of battle
  Had been fiercely stricken down.


  18 THE DYING BONDMAN.

  He had longed to gain his freedom,
  Waited, watched and hoped in vain,
  Till his life was slowly ebbing--
  Almost broken was his chain.

  By his bedside stood the master,
  Gazing on the dying one,
  Knowing by the dull grey shadows
  That life's sands were almost run.

  "Master," said the dying bondman,
  "Home and friends I soon shall see;
  But before I reach my country,
  Master write  that I am free;

  "For the spirits of my fathers
  Would shrink back from me in pride,
  If I told them at our greeting
  I a slave had lived and died;

  "Give to me the precious token,
  That my kindred dead may see--
  Master! write it, write it quickly!
  Master! write that I am free!"

  At his earnest plea the master
  Wrote for him the glad release,


  "A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM." 19

  O'er his wan and wasted features
  Flitted one sweet smile of peace.

  Eagerly he grasped the writing;
  "I am free!" at last he said.
  Backward fell upon the pillow,
  He was free among the dead.


  "A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM."

  Only a little scrap of blue
     Preserved with loving care,
  But earth has not a brilliant hue
     To me more bright and fair.

  Strong drink, like a raging demon,
     Laid on my heart his hand,
  When my darling joined with others
     The Loyal Legion * band.

  But mystic angels called away
     My loved and precious child,
  And o'er life's dark and stormy way
     Swept waves of anguish wild.

  * The Temperance Band,




  20 "A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM."

  This badge of the Loyal Legion
     We placed upon her breast,
  As she lay in her little coffin
     Taking her last sweet rest.

  To wear that badge as a token
     She earnestly did crave,
  So we laid it on her bosom
     To wear it in the grave.

  Where sorrow would never reach her
     Nor harsh words smite her ear;
  Nor her eyes in death dimmed slumber
     Would ever shed a tear.

  "What means this badge?" said her father,
     Whom we had tried to save;
  Who said, when we told her story,
     "Don't put it in the grave."

  We took the badge from her bosom
     And laid it on a chair;
  And men by drink deluded
     Knelt by that badge in prayer.

  And vowed in that hour of sorrow
     From drink they would abstain;


  THE SPARROW'S FALL. 21

  And this little badge became the wedge
     Which broke their galling chain.

  And lifted the gloomy shadows
     That overspread my life,
  And flooding my home with gladness,
     Made me a happy wife.

  And this is why this scrap of blue
     Is precious in my sight;
  It changed my sad and gloomy home
     From darkness into light.



  THE SPARROW'S FALL.

  Too frail to soar--a feeble thing--
  It fell to earth with fluttering wing;
  But God, who watches over all,
  Beheld that little sparrow's fall.

  'Twas not a bird with plumage gay,
  Filling the air with its morning lay;
  'Twas not an eagle bold and strong,
  Borne on the tempest's wing along.


  22 THE SPARROW'S FALL.

  Only a brown and weesome thing,
  With drooping head and listless wing;
  It could not drift beyond His sight
  Who marshals the splendid stars of night.

  Its dying chirp fell on His ears,
  Who tunes the music of the spheres,
  Who hears the hungry lion's call,
  And spreads a table for us all.

  Its mission of song at last is done,
  No more will it greet the rising sun;
  That tiny bird has found a rest
  More calm than its mother's downy breast

  Oh, restless heart, learn thou to trust
  In God, so tender, strong and just;
  In whose love and mercy everywhere
  His humblest children have a share.

  If in love He numbers ev'ry hair,
  Whether the strands be dark or fair,
  Shall we not learn to calmly rest,
  Like children, on our Father's breast?


  GOD BLESS OUR NATIVE LAND. 23

  GOD BLESS OUR NATIVE LAND.

  God bless our native land,
     Land of the newly free,
  Oh may she ever stand
     For truth and liberty.

  God bless our native land,
     Where sleep our kindred dead,
  Let peace at thy command
     Above their graves be shed.

  God help our native land,
     Bring surcease to her strife,
  And shower from thy hand
     A more abundant life.

  God bless our native land,
     Her homes and children bless,
  Oh may she ever stand
     For truth and righteousness.


  24 DANDELIONS.


  DANDELIONS.

  Welcome children of the Spring,
     In your garbs of green and gold,
  Lifting up your sun-crowned heads
     On the verdant plain and wold.

  As a bright and joyous troop
     From the breast of earth ye came
  Fair and lovely are your cheeks,
     With sun-kisses all aflame.

  In the dusty streets and lanes,
     Where the lowly children play,
  There as gentle friends ye smile,
     Making brighter life's highway

  Dewdrops and the morning sun,
     Weave your garments fair and bright,
  And we welcome you to-day
     As the children of the light.

  Children of the earth and sun.
     We are slow to understand
  All the richness of the gifts
     Flowing from our Father's hand.


  THE BUILDING. 25

  Were our vision clearer far,
     In this sin-dimmed world of ours,
  Would we not more thankful be
     For the love that sends us flowers?

  Welcome, early visitants,
     With your sun-crowned golden hair,
  With your message to our hearts
     Of our Father's loving care.



  THE BUILDING.

  "Build me a house," said the Master,
     "But not on the shifting sand,
  Mid the wreck and roar of tempests,
     A house that will firmly stand.

  "I will bring thee windows of agates,
     And gates of carbuncles bright,
  And thy fairest courts and portals
     Shall be filled with love and light.

  "Thou shalt build with fadeless rubies,
     All fashioned around the throne,
  A house that shall last forever,
     With Christ as the cornerstone.


  26 HOME, SWEET HOME.

  "It shall be a royal mansion,
     A fair and beautiful thing,
  It will be the presence-chamber
     Of thy Saviour, Lord and King.

  "Thy house shall be bound with pinions
     To mansions of rest above,
  But grace shall forge all the fetters
     With the links and cords of love.

  "Thou shalt be free in this mansion
     From sorrow and pain of heart,
  For the peace of God shall enter,
     And never again depart."



  HOME, SWEET HOME.

  Sharers of a common country,
     They had met in deadly strife;
  Men who should have been as brothers
     Madly sought each other's life.

  In the silence of the even,
     When the cannon's lips were dumb,


  HOME, SWEET HOME. 27

  Thoughts of home and all its loved ones
     To the soldier's heart would come.

  On the margin of a river,
     'Mid the evening's dews and damps,
  Could be heard the sounds of music
     Rising from two hostile camps.

  One was singing of its section
     Down in Dixie, Dixie's land,
  And the other of the banner
     Waved so long from strand to strand.

  In the land where Dixie's ensign
     Floated o'er the hopeful slave,
  Rose the song that freedom's banner,
     Starry-lighted, long might wave.

  From the fields of strife and carnage,
     Gentle thoughts began to roam,
  And a tender strain of music
  Rose with words of "Home, Sweet Home."

  Then the hearts of strong men melted,
     For amid our grief and sin
  Still remains that "touch of nature,"
   Telling us we all are kin.


  28 THE PURE IN HEART SHALL SEE GOD.

  In one grand but gentle chorus,
     Floating to the starry dome,
  Came the words that brought them nearer,
     Words that told of "Home, Sweet Home."

  For awhile, all strife forgotten,
     They were only brothers then,
  Joining in the sweet old chorus,
     Not as soldiers, but as men.

  Men whose hearts would flow together,
     Though apart their feet might roam,
  Found a tie they could not sever,
     In the mem'ry of each home.

  Never may the steps of carnage
     Shake our land from shore to shore,
  But may mother, home and Heaven,
     Be our watchwords evermore.



  THE PURE IN HEART SHALL SEE GOD.

  They shall see Him in the crimson flush
     Of morning's early light,
  In the drapery of sunset,
     Around the couch of night.


  THE PURE IN HEART SHALL SEE GOD. 29

  When the clouds drop down their fatness,
     In late and early rain,
  They shall see His glorious footprints
     On valley, hill and plain.

  They shall see Him when the cyclone
     Breathes terror through the land;
  They shall see Him 'mid the murmurs
     Of zephyrs soft and bland.

  They shall see Him when the lips of health,
     Breath vigor through each nerve,
  When pestilence clasps hands with death,
     His purposes to serve.

  They shall see Him when the trembling earth
     Is rocking to and fro;
  They shall see Him in the order
     The seasons come and go.

  They shall see Him when the storms of war
     Sweep wildly through the land;
  When peace descends like gentle dew
     They still shall see His hand.

  They shall see Him in the city
     Of gems and pearls of light,


  30 NOWHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD.

  They shall see Him in his beauty,
     And walk with Him in white.

  To living founts their feet shall tend,
     And Christ shall be their guide,
  Beloved of God, their rest shall be
     In safety by His side.



  HE "HAD NOT WHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD."

  The conies had their hiding-place,
     The wily fox with stealthy tread
  A covert found, but Christ, the Lord,
     Had not a place to lay his head.

  The eagle had an eyrie home,
     The blithesome bird its quiet rest,
  But not the humblest spot on earth
     Was by the Son of God possessed.

  Princes and kings had palaces,
     With grandeur could adorn each tomb,
  For Him who came with love and life,
     They had no home, they gave no room.


  GO WORK IN MY VINEYARD. 31

  The hands whose touch sent thrills of joy
     Through nerves unstrung and palsied
        frame,
  The feet that travelled for our need,
     Were nailed unto the cross of shame.

  How dare I murmur at my lot,
     Or talk of sorrow, pain and loss,
  When Christ was in a manger laid,
     And died in anguish on the cross.

  That homeless one beheld beyond
     His lonely agonizing pain,
  A love outflowing from His heart,
     That all the wandering world would gain.



  GO WORK IN MY VINEYARD.

  Go work in my vineyard, said the Lord,
     And gather the bruised grain;
  But the reapers had left the stubble bare,
     And I trod the soil in pain.


  32 GO WORK IN MY VINEYARD.

  The fields of my Lord are wide and broad,
     He has pastures fair and green,
  And vineyards that drink the golden light
     Which flows from the sun's bright sheen.

  I heard the joy of the reapers' song,
     As they gathered golden grain;
  Then wearily turned unto my task,
     With a lonely sense of pain.

  Sadly I turned from the sun's fierce glare,
     And sought the quiet shade,
  And over my dim and weary eyes
     Sleep's peaceful fingers strayed.

  I dreamed I joined with a restless throng,
     Eager for pleasure and gain;
  But ever and anon a stumbler fell,
     And uttered a cry of pain.

  But the eager crowd still hurried on,
     Too busy to pause or heed,
  When a voice rang sadly through my soul,
     You must staunch these wounds that bleed.

  My hands were weak, but I reached them out
     To feebler ones than mine,


  RENEWAL OF STRENGTH. 33

  And over the shadows of my life
     Stole the light of a peace divine.

  Oh! then my task was a sacred thing,
     How precious it grew in my eyes!
  'Twas mine to gather the bruised grain
     For the "Lord of Paradise."

  And when the reapers shall lay their grain
     On the floors of golden light,
  I feel that mine with its broken sheaves
     Shall be precious in His sight.

  Though thorns may often pierce my feet,
     And the shadows still abide,
  The mists will vanish before His smile,
     There will be light at eventide.



  RENEWAL OF STRENGTH.

  The prison-house in which I live
     Is falling to decay,
  But God renews my spirit's strength,
     Within these walls of clay.


  34 JAMIE'S PUZZLE.

  For me a dimness slowly creeps
     Around earth's fairest light,
  But heaven grows clearer to my view,
     And fairer to my sight.

  It may be earth's sweet harmonies
     Are duller to my ear,
  But music from my Father's house
     Begins to float more near.

  Then let the pillars of my home
     Crumble and fall away;
  Lo, God's dear love within my soul
     Renews it day by day.



  JAMIE'S PUZZLE.

  There was grief within our household
     Because of a vacant chair.
  Our mother, so loved and precious,
     No longer was sitting there.


  JAMIE'S PUZZLE. 35

  Our hearts grew heavy with sorrow,
     Our eyes with tears were blind,
  And little Jamie was wondering,
     Why we were left behind.

  We had told our little darling,
     Of the land of love and light,
  Of the saints all crowned with glory,
     And enrobed in spotless white.

  We said that our precious mother,
     Had gone to that land so fair,
  To dwell with beautiful angels,
     And to be forever there.

  But the child was sorely puzzled,
     Why dear grandmamma should go
  To dwell in a stranger city,
     When her children loved her so.

  But again the mystic angel
     Came with swift and silent tread,
  And our sister, Jamie's mother,
     Was enrolled among the dead.


  To us the mystery deepened,
     To Jamie it seemed more clear;


  36 TRUTH.

  Grandma, he said, must be lonesome,
     And mamma has gone to her.

  But the question lies unanswered
     In our little Jamie's mind,
  Why she should go to our mother,
     And leave her children behind;

  To dwell in that lovely city,
     From all that was dear to part,
  From children who loved to nestle
     So closely around her heart.

  Dear child, like you, we are puzzled,
     With problems that still remain;
  But think in the great hereafter
     Their meaning will all be plain.



  TRUTH.

  A rock, for ages, stern and high,
  Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky,
  And never bowed his haughty crest
  When angry storms around him prest.
  Morn, springing from the arms of night,
  Had often bathed his brow with light.


  TRUTH. 37

  And kissed the shadows from his face
  With tender love and gentle grace.

  Day, pausing at the gates of rest,
  Smiled on him from the distant West,
  And from her throne the dark-browed Night
  Threw round his path her softest light.
  And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
  Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;
  He bared his brow to every blast
  And scorned the tempest as it passed.

  One day a tiny, humble seed--
  The keenest eye would hardly heed--
  Fell trembling at that stern rock's base,
  And found a lowly hiding-place.
  A ray of light, and drop of dew,
  Came with a message, kind and true;
  They told her of the world so bright,
  Its love, its joy, and rosy light,
  And lured her from her hiding-place,
  To gaze upon earth's glorious face.

  So, peeping timid from the ground,
  She clasped the ancient rock around,
  And climbing up with childish grace,
  She held him with a close embrace;


  38 DEATH OF THE OLD SEA KING.

  Her clinging was a thing of dread;
  Where'er she touched a fissure spread,
  And he who'd breasted many a storm
  Stood frowning there, a mangled form;
  A Truth, dropped in the silent earth,
  May seem a thing of little worth,
  Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,
  It saps its pillars proud and strong,
  And o'er the fallen ruin weaves
  The brightest blooms and fairest leaves.



  DEATH OF THE OLD SEA KING.

  'Twas a fearful night--the tempest raved
     With loud and wrathful pride,
  The storm-king harnessed his lightning steeds,
     And rode on the raging tide.

  The sea-king lay on his bed of death,
     Pale mourners around him bent;
  They knew the wild and fitful life
     Of their chief was almost spent.

  His ear was growing dull in death
     When the angry storm he heard,


  DEATH OF THE OLD SEA KING. 39

  The sluggish blood in the old man's veins
     With sudden vigor stirred.

  "I hear them call," cried the dying man,
     His eyes grew full of light;
  "Now bring me here my warrior robes,
     My sword and armor bright.

  "In the tempest's lull I heard a voice,
     I knew 'twas Odin's call.
  The Valkyrs are gathering round my bed
     To lead me unto his hall.

  "Bear me unto my noblest ship,
     Light up a funeral pyre;
  I'll walk to the palace of the braves
     Through a path of flame and fire."

  Oh! wild and bright was the stormy light
     That flashed from the old man's eye,
  As they bore him from the couch of death
     To his battle-ship to die,

  And lit with many a mournful torch
     The sea-king's dying bed,
  And like a banner fair and bright
     The flames around him spread.


  40 SAVE THE BOYS.

  But they heard no cry of anguish
     Break through that fiery wall,
  With rigid brow and silent lips
     He was seeking Odin's hall.

  Through a path of fearful splendor,
     While strong men held their breath,
  The brave old man went boldly forth
     And calmly talked with death.



  SAVE THE BOYS.

  Like Dives in the deeps of Hell
  I cannot break this fearful spell,
  Nor quench the fires I've madly nursed,
  Nor cool this dreadful raging thirst.
  Take back your pledge--ye come too late!
  Ye cannot save me from my fate,
  Nor bring me back departed joys;
  But ye can try to save the boys.

  Ye bid me break my fiery chain,
  Arise and be a man again,


  SAVE THE BOYS. 41

  When every street with snares is spread,
  And nets of sin where'er I tread.
  No; I must reap as I did sow.
  The seeds of sin bring crops of woe;
  But with my latest breath I'll crave
  That ye will try the boys to save.

  These bloodshot eyes were once so bright;
  This sin-crushed heart was glad and light;
  But by the wine-cup's ruddy glow
  I traced a path to shame and woe.
  A captive to my galling chain,
  I've tried to rise, but tried in vain--
  The cup allures and then destroys.
  Oh! from its thraldom save the boys.

  Take from your streets those traps of hell
  Into whose gilded snares I fell.
  Oh! freemen, from these foul decoys
  Arise, and vote to save the boys.
  Oh, ye who license men to trade
  In draughts that charm and then degrade,
  Before ye hear the cry, Too late,
  Oh, save the boys from my sad fate.


  42 NOTHING AND SOMETHING.

  NOTHING AND SOMETHING.

  It is nothing to me, the beauty said,
  With a careless toss of her pretty head;
  The man is weak if he can't refrain
  From the cup you say is fraught with pain.
  It was something to her in after years,
  When her eyes were drenched with burning
        tears,
  And she watched in lonely grief and dread,
  And startled to hear a staggering tread.

  It is nothing to me, the mother said;
  I have no fear that my boy will tread
  In the downward path of sin and shame,
  And crush my heart and darken his name.
  It was something to her when that only son
  From the path of right was early won,
  And madly cast in the flowing bowl
  A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul.

  It is nothing to me, the young man cried:
  In his eye was a flash of scorn and pride;
  I heed not the dreadful things ye tell:
  I can rule myself I know full well.


  NOTHING AND SOMETHING. 43

  It was something to him when in prison he lay
  The victim of drink, life ebbing away;
  And thought of his wretched child and wife,
  And the mournful wreck of his wasted life.

  It is nothing to me, the merchant said,
  As over his ledger he bent his head;
  I'm busy to-day with tare and tret,
  And I have no time to fume and fret.
  It was something to him when over the wire
  A message came from a funeral pyre--
  A drunken conductor had wrecked a train,
  And his wife and child were among the slain.

  It is nothing to me, the voter said,
  The party's loss is my greatest dread;
  Then gave his vote for the liquor trade,
  Though hearts were crushed and drunkards
        made.
  It was something to him in after life,
  When his daughter became a drunkard's wife
  And her hungry children cried for bread,
  And trembled to hear their father's tread.

  Is it nothing for us to idly sleep
  While the cohorts of death their vigils keep?
  To gather the young and thoughtless in,
  And grind in our midst a grist of sin?



  44 VASHTI.

  It is something, yes, all, for us to stand
  Clasping by faith our Saviour's hand;
  To learn to labor, live and fight
  On the side of God and changeless light.



  VASHTI.

  She leaned her head upon her hand
     And heard the King's decree--
  "My lords are feasting in my halls;
     Bid Vashti come to me.

  "I've shown the treasures of my house,
     My costly jewels rare,
  But with the glory of her eyes
     No rubies can compare.

  "Adorn'd and crown'd I'd have her come,
     With all her queenly grace,
  And, 'mid my lords and mighty men,
     Unveil her lovely face.

  "Each gem that sparkles in my crown,
     Or glitters on my throne,


  VASHTI. 45

  Grows poor and pale when she appears,
     My beautiful, my own!"

  All waiting stood the chamberlains
     To hear the Queen's reply.
  They saw her cheek grow deathly pale,
     But light flash'd to her eye:

  "Go, tell the King," she proudly said,
     "That I am Persia's Queen,
  And by his crowds of merry men
     I never will be seen.

  "I'll take the crown from off my head
     And tread it 'neath my feet,
  Before their rude and careless gaze
     My shrinking eyes shall meet.

  "A queen unveil'd before the crowd!--
     Upon each lip my name!--
  Why, Persia's women all would blush
     And weep for Vashti's shame!

  "Go back!" she cried, and waved her hand,
     And grief was in her eye:
  "Go, tell the King," she sadly said,
     "That I would rather die."


  46 VASHTI.

  They brought her message to the King;
     Dark flash'd his angry eye;
  'Twas as the lightning ere the storm
     Hath swept in fury by.

  Then bitterly outspoke the King,
     Through purple lips of wrath--
  "What shall be done to her who dares
     To cross your monarch's path?"

  Then spake his wily counsellors--
     "O King of this fair land!
  From distant Ind to Ethiop,
     All bow to thy command.

  "But if, before thy servants' eyes,
     This thing they plainly see,
  That Vashti doth not heed thy will
     Nor yield herself to thee,

  "The women, restive 'neath our rule,
     Would learn to scorn our name,
  And from her deed to us would come
     Reproach and burning shame.

  "Then, gracious King, sign with thy hand
     This stern but just decree,


  THANK GOD FOR LITTLE CHILDREN. 47

  That Vashti lay aside her crown,
     Thy Queen no more to be."

  She heard again the King's command,
     And left her high estate;
  Strong in her earnest womanhood,
     She calmly met her fate,

  And left the palace of the King,
     Proud of her spotless name--
  A woman who could bend to grief,
     But would not bow to shame.



  THANK GOD FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.

  Thank God for little children,
     Bright flowers by earth's wayside,
  The dancing, joyous lifeboats
     Upon life's stormy tide.

  Thank God for little children;
     When our skies are cold and gray,
  They come as sunshine to our hearts,
     And charm our cares away.


  48 THANK GOD FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.

  I almost think the angels,
     Who tend life's garden fair,
  Drop down the sweet wild blossoms
     That bloom around us here.

  It seems a breath of heaven
     Round many a cradle lies,
  And every little baby
     Brings a message from the skies.

  Dear mothers, guard these jewels.
     As sacred offerings meet,
  A wealth of household treasures
     To lay at Jesus' feet.



  THE MARTYR OF ALABAMA.

       "Tim Thompson, a little negro boy, was asked
  to dance for the amusement of some white
  toughs.  He refused, saying he was a church
  member. One of the men knocked him
  down with a club and then danced upon his
  prostrate form. He then shot the boy in the
  hip. The boy is dead; his murderer is still at
  large."--News Item.

  He lifted up his pleading eyes,
     And scanned each cruel face,
  Where cold and brutal cowardice
     Had left its evil trace.

  It was when tender memories
     Round Beth'lem's manger lay,

  (49)


  50 THE MARTYR OF ALABAMA.

  And mothers told their little ones
     Of Jesu's natal day.

  And of the Magi from the East
     Who came their gifts to bring,
  And bow in rev'rence at the feet
     Of Salem's new-born King.

  And how the herald angels sang
     The choral song of peace,
  That war should close his wrathful lips,
     And strife and carnage cease.

  At such an hour men well may hush
     Their discord and their strife,
  And o'er that manger clasp their hands
     With gifts to brighten life.

  Alas! that in our favored land,
     That cruelty and crime
  Should cast their shadows o'er a day.
     The fairest pearl of time.

  A dark-browed boy had drawn anear
     A band of savage men,
  Just as a hapless lamb might stray
     Into a tiger's den.


  THE MARTYR OF ALABAMA. 51

  Cruel and dull, they saw in him
     For sport an evil chance,
  And then demanded of the child
     To give to them a dance.

  "Come dance for us," the rough men said;
     "I can't," the child replied,
  "I cannot for the dear Lord's sake,
     Who for my sins once died."

  Tho' they were strong and he was weak,
     He wouldn't his Lord deny.
  His life lay in their cruel hands,
     But he for Christ could die.

  Heard they aright? Did that brave child
     Their mandates dare resist?
  Did he against their stern commands
     Have courage to insist?

  Then recklessly a man (?) arose,
     And dealt a fearful blow.
  He crushed the portals of that life,
     And laid the brave child low.

  And trampled on his prostrate form,
     As on a broken toy;


  52 THE MARTYR OF ALABAMA.

  Then danced with careless, brutal feet,
     Upon the murdered boy.

  Christians! behold that martyred child!
     His blood cries from the ground;
  Before the sleepless eye of God,
     He shows each gaping wound.

  Oh! Church of Christ arise! arise!
     Lest crimson stain thy hand,
  When God shall inquisition make
     For blood shed in the land.

  Take sackcloth of the darkest hue,
     And shroud the pulpits round;
  Servants of him who cannot lie
     Sit mourning on the ground.

  Let holy horror blanch each brow,
     Pale every cheek with fears,
  And rocks and stones, if ye could speak,
     Ye well might melt to tears.

  Through every fane send forth a cry,
     Of sorrow and regret,
  Nor in an hour of careless ease
     Thy brother's wrongs forget.


  THE NIGHT OF DEATH. 53

  Veil not thine eyes, nor close thy lips,
     Nor speak with bated breath;
  This evil shall not always last,
     The end of it is death.

  Avert the doom that crime must bring
     Upon a guilty land;
  Strong in the strength that God supplies,
     For truth and justice stand.

  For Christless men, with reckless hands,
     Are sowing round thy path
  The tempests wild that yet shall break
     In whirlwinds of God's wrath.



  THE NIGHT OF DEATH.

  Twas a night of dreadful horror,--
     Death was sweeping through the land;
  And the wings of dark destruction
     Were outstretched from strand to strand

  Strong men's hearts grew faint with terror,
     As the tempest and the waves


  54 THE NIGHT OF DEATH.

  Wrecked their homes and swept them downward,
  Suddenly to yawning graves.

  'Mid the wastes of ruined households,
     And the tempest's wild alarms,
  Stood a terror-stricken mother
     With a child within her arms.

  Other children huddled 'round her,
     Each one nestling in her heart;
  Swift in thought and swift in action,
     She at least from one must part.

  Then she said unto her daughter,
     "Strive to save one child from death."
  "Which one?" said the anxious daughter,
     As she stood with bated breath.

  Oh! the anguish of that mother;
     What despair was in her eye!
  All her little ones were precious;
     Which one should she leave to die?

  Then outspake the brother Bennie:
     "I will take the little one."
  "No," exclaimed the anxious mother;
     "No, my child, it can't be done."


  THE NIGHT OF DEATH. 55

  "See! my boy, the waves are rising,
     Save yourself and leave the child!"
  "I will trust in Christ," he answered;
     Grasped the little one and smiled.

  Through the roar of wind and waters
     Ever and anon she cried;
  But throughout the night of terror
     Never Bennie's voice replied.

  But above the waves' wild surging
     He had found a safe retreat,
  As if God had sent an angel,
     Just to guide his wandering feet.

  When the storm had spent its fury,
     And the sea gave up its dead
  She was mourning for her loved ones,
     Lost amid that night of dread.

  While her head was bowed in anguish,
     On her ear there fell a voice,
  Bringing surcease to her sorrow,
     Bidding all her heart rejoice.

  "Didn't I tell you true?" said Bennie,
     And his eyes were full of light,


  56 MOTHER'S TREASURES.

  "When I told you God would help me
     Through the dark and dreadful night?"

  And he placed the little darling
     Safe within his mother's arms,
  Feeling Christ had been his guardian,
     'Mid the dangers and alarms.

  Oh! for faith so firm and precious,
     In the darkest, saddest night,
  Till life's gloom-encircled shadows
     Fade in everlasting light.

  And upon the mount of vision
     We our loved and lost shall greet,
  With earth's wildest storms behind us,
     And its cares beneath our feet.



  MOTHER'S TREASURES.

  Two little children sit by my side,
     I call them Lily and Daffodil;
  I gaze on them with a mother's pride,
     One is Edna, the other is Will.

  Both have eyes of starry light,
     And laughing lips o'er teeth of pearl.


  MOTHER'S TREASURES. 57

  I would not change for a diadem
    My noble boy and darling girl.

  To-night my heart o'erflows with joy;
     I hold them as a sacred trust;
  I fain would hide them in my heart,
     Safe from tarnish of moth and rust.

  What should I ask for my dear boy?
     The richest gifts of wealth or fame?
  What for my girl?  A loving heart
     And a fair and a spotless name?

  What for my boy?  That he should stand
     A pillar of strength to the state?
  What for my girl?  That she should be
     The friend of the poor and desolate?

  I do not ask they shall never tread
     With weary feet the paths of pain.
  I ask that in the darkest hour
     They may faithful and true remain.

  I only ask their lives may be
     Pure as gems in the gates of pearl,
  Lives to brighten and bless the world--
     This I ask for my boy and girl.




  58 THE REFINER'S GOLD.

  I ask to clasp their hands again
     'Mid the holy hosts of heaven,
  Enraptured say: "I am here, oh! God,
     "And the children Thou hast given."



  THE REFINER'S GOLD.

  He stood before my heart's closed door,
     And asked to enter in;
  But I had barred the passage o'er
     By unbelief and sin.

  He came with nail-prints in his hands,
     To set my spirit free;
  With wounded feet he trod a path
     To come and sup with me.

  He found me poor and brought me gold,
     The fire of love had tried,
  And garments whitened by his blood,
     My wretchedness to hide.

  The glare of life had dimmed my eyes,
     Its glamour was too bright.
  He came with ointment in his hands
     To heal my darkened sight.


  THE REFINER'S GOLD. 59

  He knew my heart was tempest-tossed,
     By care and pain oppressed;
  He whispered to my burdened heart,
     Come unto me and rest.

  He found me weary, faint and worn,
     On barren mountains cold;
  With love's constraint he drew me on,
     To shelter in his fold.

  Oh! foolish heart, how slow wert thou
     To welcome thy dear guest,
  To change thy weariness and care
     For comfort, peace and rest.

  Close to his side, oh! may I stay,
     Just to behold his face,
  Till I shall wear within my soul
     The image of his grace.

  The grace that changes hearts of stone
     To tenderness and love,
  And bids us run with willing feet
     Unto his courts above.


  60 A STORY OF THE REBELLION.

  A STORY OF THE REBELLION.

  The treacherous sands had caught our boat,
     And held it with a strong embrace
  And death at our imprisoned crew
     Was sternly looking face to face.

  With anxious hearts, but failing strength,
     We strove to push the boat from shore;
  But all in vain, for there we lay
     With bated breath and useless oar.

  Around us in a fearful storm
     The fiery hail fell thick and fast;
  And we engirded by the sand,
     Could not return the dreadful blast.

  When one arose upon whose brow
     The ardent sun had left his trace,
  A noble purpose strong and high
     Uplighting all his dusky face.

  Perchance within that fateful hour
     The wrongs of ages thronged apace;
  But with it came the glorious hope
     Of swift deliverance to his race.

  Of galling chains asunder rent,
     Of severed hearts again made one,


  A STORY OF THE REBELLION. 61

  Of freedom crowning all the land
     Through battles gained and victories won.

  "Some one," our hero firmly said,
     "Must die to get us out of this;"
  Then leaped upon the strand and bared
     His bosom to the bullets' hiss.

  "But ye are soldiers, and can fight,
     May win in battles yet unfought;
  I have no offering but my life,
     And if they kill me it is nought."

  With steady hands he grasped the boat,
     And boldly pushed it from the shore;
  Then fell by rebel bullets pierced,
     His life work grandly, nobly o'er.

  Our boat was rescued from the sands
     And launched in safety on the tide;
  But he our comrade good and grand,
     In our defence had bravely died.



  BURIAL OF SARAH.

  He stood before the sons of Heth,
     And bowed his sorrowing head;


  62 BURIAL OF SARAH.

  "I've come," he said, "to buy a place
     Where I may lay my dead.

  "I am a stranger in your land,
     My home has lost its light;
  Grant me a place where I may lay
     My dead away from sight."

  Then tenderly the sons of Heth
     Gazed on the mourner's face,
  And said, "Oh, Prince, amid our dead,
     Choose thou her resting-place.

  "The sepulchres of those we love,
     We place at thy command;
  Against the plea thy grief hath made
     We close not heart nor hand."

  The patriarch rose and bowed his head,
     And said, "One place I crave;
  'Tis at the end of Ephron's field,
     And called Machpelah's cave.

  "Entreat him that he sell to me
     For her last sleep that cave;
  I do not ask for her I loved
     The freedom of a grave."


  BURIAL OF SARAH. 63

  The son of Zohar answered him,
     "Hearken, my lord, to me;
  Before our sons, the field and cave
     I freely give to thee."

  "I will not take it as a gift,"
     The grand old man then said;
  "I pray thee let me buy the place
     Where I may lay my dead."

  And with the promise in his heart,
     His seed should own that land,
  He gave the shekels for the field
     He took from Ephron's hand.

  And saw afar the glorious day
     His chosen seed should tread,
  The soil where he in sorrow lay
     His loved and cherished dead.



  GOING EAST.

  She came from the East a fair, young bride,
     With a light and a bounding heart,
  To find in the distant West a home
     With her husband to make a start.


  64 GOING EAST.

  He builded his cabin far away,
     Where the prairie flower bloomed wild;
  Her love made lighter all his toil,
     And joy and hope around him smiled.

  She plied her hands to life's homely tasks,
     And helped to build his fortunes up;
  While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet,
     Were mingled and mixed in her cup.

  He sowed in his fields of golden grain,
     All the strength of his manly prime;
  Nor music of birds, nor brooks, nor bees,
     Was as sweet as the dollar's chime.

  She toiled and waited through weary years
     For the fortune that came at length;
  But toil and care and hope deferred,
     Had stolen and wasted her strength.

  The cabin changed to a stately home,
     Rich carpets were hushing her tread;
  But light was fading from her eye,
     And the bloom from her cheek had fled.

  Slower and heavier grew her step,
     While his gold and his gains increased;


  GOING EAST. 65

  But his proud domain had not the charm
     Of her humble home in the East.

  Within her eye was a restless light,
     And a yearning that never ceased,
  A longing to see the dear old home
     She had left in the distant East.

  A longing to clasp her mother's hand,
     And nestle close to her heart,
  And to feel the heavy cares of life
     Like the sun-kissed shadows depart.

  Her husband was adding field to field,
     And new wealth to his golden store;
  And little thought the shadow of death
     Was entering in at his door.

  He had no line to sound the depths
     Of her tears repressed and unshed;
  Nor dreamed 'mid plenty a human heart
     Could be starving, but not for bread.

  The hungry heart was stilled at last;
     Its restless, baffled yearning ceased.
  A lonely man sat by the bier
     Of a corpse that was going East.


  66 THE HERMIT'S SACRIFICE.

  THE HERMIT'S SACRIFICE.

  From Rome's palaces and villas
     Gaily issued forth a throng;
  From her humbler habitations
     Moved a human tide along.

  Haughty dames and blooming maidens,
     Men who knew not mercy's sway,
  Thronged into the Coliseum
     On that Roman holiday.

  From the lonely wilds of Asia,
     From her jungles far away,
  From the distant torrid regions,
     Rome had gathered beasts of prey.

  Lions restless, roaring, rampant,
     Tigers with their stealthy tread,
  Leopards bright, and fierce, and fiery,
     Met in conflict wild and dread.

  Fierce and fearful was the carnage
     Of the maddened beasts of prey,
  As they fought and rent each other
     Urged by men more fierce than they.

  Till like muffled thunders breaking
     On a vast and distant shore,


  THE HERMIT'S SACRIFICE. 67

  Fainter grew the yells of tigers,
     And the lions' dreadful roar.

  On the crimson-stained arena
     Lay the victims of the fight;
  Eyes which once had glared with anguish,
     Lost in death their baleful light.

  Then uprose the gladiators
     Armed for conflict unto death,
  Waiting for the prefect's signal,
     Cold and stern with bated breath.

  "Ave Caesar, morituri,
     Te, salutant," rose the cry
  From the lips of men ill-fated,
     Doomed to suffer and to die.

  Then began the dreadful contest,
     Lives like chaff were thrown away,
  Rome with all her pride and power
     Butchered for a holiday.

  Eagerly the crowd were waiting,
     Loud the clashing sabres rang;
  When between the gladiators
     All unarmed a hermit sprang.


  68 THE HERMIT'S SACRIFICE.

  "Cease your bloodshed," cried the hermit,
     "On this carnage place your ban;"
  But with flashing swords they answered,
     "Back unto your place, old man."

  From their path the gladiators
     Thrust the strange intruder back,
  Who between their hosts advancing
     Calmly parried their attack.

  All undaunted by their weapons,
     Stood the old heroic man;
  While a maddened cry of anger
     Through the vast assembly ran.

  "Down with him," cried out the people,
     As with thumbs unbent they glared,
  Till the prefect gave the signal
     That his life should not be spared.

  Men grew wild with wrathful passion,
     When his fearless words were said
  Cruelly they fiercely showered
     Stones on his devoted head.

  Bruised and bleeding fell the hermit,
     Victor in that hour of strife;


  SONGS FOR THE PEOPLE. 69

  Gaining in his death a triumph
     That he could not win in life.

  Had he uttered on the forum
     Struggling thoughts within him born,
  Men had jeered his words as madness,
     But his deed they could not scorn.

  Not in vain had been his courage,
     Nor for naught his daring deed;
  From his grave his mangled body
     Did for wretched captives plead.

  From that hour Rome, grown more thoughtful,
     Ceased her sport in human gore;
  And into her Coliseum
     Gladiators came no more.



  SONGS FOR THE PEOPLE.

  Let me make the songs for the people,
     Songs for the old and young;
  Songs to stir like a battle-cry
     Wherever they are sung.

  Not for the clashing of sabres,
     For carnage nor for strife;


  70 SONGS FOR THE PEOPLE.

  But songs to thrill the hearts of men
     With more abundant life.

  Let me make the songs for the weary,
     Amid life's fever and fret,
  Till hearts shall relax their tension,
     And careworn brows forget.

  Let me sing for little children,
     Before their footsteps stray,
  Sweet anthems of love and duty,
     To float o'er life's highway.

  I would sing for the poor and aged,
     When shadows dim their sight;
  Of the bright and restful mansions,
     Where there shall be no night.

  Our world, so worn and weary,
     Needs music, pure and strong,
  To hush the jangle and discords
     Of sorrow, pain, and wrong.

  Music to soothe all its sorrow,
     Till war and crime shall cease;
  And the hearts of men grown tender
     Girdle the world with peace.


  LET THE LIGHT ENTER. 71

  LET THE LIGHT ENTER.

  The dying words of Goethe.

  "Light! more light! the shadows deepen,
     And my life is ebbing low,
  Throw the windows widely open:
     Light! more light! before I go.

  "Softly let the balmy sunshine
     Play around my dying bed,
  E'er the dimly lighted valley
     I with lonely feet must tread.

  "Light! more light! for Death is weaving
     Shadows 'round my waning sight,
  And I fain would gaze upon him
     Through a stream of earthly light."

  Not for greater gifts of genius;
     Not for thoughts more grandly bright,
  All the dying poet whispers
     Is a prayer for light, more light.

  Heeds he not the gathered laurels,
     Fading slowly from his sight;
  All the poet's aspirations
     Centre in that prayer for light.


  72 AN APPEAL TO MY COUNTRYWOMEN.

  Gracious Saviour, when life's day-dreams
     Melt and vanish from the sight,
  May our dim and longing vision
     Then be blessed with light, more light.



  AN APPEAL TO MY COUNTRYWOMEN.

  You can sigh o'er the sad-eyed Armenian
     Who weeps in her desolate home.
  You can mourn o'er the exile of Russia
     From kindred and friends doomed to roam.

  You can pity the men who have woven
     From passion and appetite chains
  To coil with a terrible tension
     Around their heartstrings and brains.

  You can sorrow o'er little children
     Disinherited from their birth,
  The wee waifs and toddlers neglected,
     Robbed of sunshine, music and mirth.

  For beasts you have gentle compassion;
     Your mercy and pity they share.
  For the wretched, outcast and fallen
     You have tenderness, love and care.


  AN APPEAL TO MY COUNTRYWOMEN. 73

  But hark! from our Southland are floating
     Sobs of anguish, murmurs of pain,
  And women heart-stricken are weeping
     Over their tortured and their slain.

  On their brows the sun has left traces;
     Shrink not from their sorrow in scorn.
  When they entered the threshold of being
     The children of a King were born.

  Each comes as a guest to the table
     The hand of our God has outspread,
  To fountains that ever leap upward,
     To share in the soil we all tread.

  When ye plead for the wrecked and fallen,
     The exile from far-distant shores,
  Remember that men are still wasting
     Life's crimson around your own doors.

  Have ye not, oh, my favored sisters,
     Just a plea, a prayer or a tear,
  For mothers who dwell 'neath the shadows
     Of agony, hatred and fear?

  Men may tread down the poor and lowly,
     May crush them in anger and hate,


  74 AN APPEAL TO MY COUNTRYWOMEN.

  But surely the mills of God's justice
     Will grind out the grist of their fate.

  Oh, people sin-laden and guilty,
     So lusty and proud in your prime,
  The sharp sickles of God's retribution
     Will gather your harvest of crime.

  Weep not, oh my well-sheltered sisters,
     Weep not for the Negro alone,
  But weep for your sons who must gather
     The crops which their fathers have sown.

  Go read on the tombstones of nations
     Of chieftains who masterful trod,
  The sentence which time has engraven,
     That they had forgotten their God.

  'Tis the judgment of God that men reap
     The tares which in madness they sow,
  Sorrow follows the footsteps of crime,
     And Sin is the consort of Woe.


  THEN AND NOW. 75

  THEN AND NOW.

  "Build me a nation," said the Lord.
  The distant nations heard the word,
  Build me a nation true and strong,
  Bar out the old world's hate and wrong;
  For men had traced with blood and tears
  The trail of weary wasting years,
  And torn and bleeding martyrs trod
  Through fire and torture up to God.

  While in the hollow of his hand
  God hid the secret of our land,
  Men warred against their fiercest foes,
  And kingdoms fell and empires rose,
  Till, weary of the old world strife,
  Men sought for broader, freer life,
  And plunged into the ocean's foam
  To find another, better home.

  And, like a vision fair and bright
  The new world broke upon their sight.
  Men grasped the prize, grew proud and strong,
  And cursed the land with crime and wrong.
  The Indian stood despoiled of lands,
  The Negro bound with servile bands,
  Oppressed through weary years of toil,
  His blood and tears bedewed the soil.



  76 THEN AND NOW.

  Then God arose in dreadful wrath,
  And judgment streamed around his path;
  His hand the captive's fetters broke,
  His lightnings shattered every yoke.
  As Israel through the Red sea trod,
  Led by the mighty hand of God,
  They passed to freedom through a flood,
  Whose every wave and surge was blood.

  And slavery, with its crime and shame,
  Went down in wrath and blood and flame
  The land was billowed-o'er with graves
  Where men had lived and died as slaves.
  Four and thirty years--what change since
        then!
  Beings once chattles now are men;
  Over the gloom of slavery's night,
  Has flashed the dawn of freedom's light.

  To-day no mother with anguish wild
  Kneels and implores that her darling child
  Shall not be torn from her bleeding heart,
  With its quivering tendrils rent apart.
  The father may soothe his child to sleep,
  And watch his slumbers calm and deep.
  No tyrant's tread will disturb his rest
  Where freedom dwells as a welcome guest.


  THEN AND NOW. 77

  His walls may be bare of pictured grace,
  His fireside the lowliest place;
  But the wife and children sheltered there
  Are his to defend and guard with care.
  Where haughty tyrants once bore rule
  Are ballot-box and public school.
  The old slave-pen of former days
  Gives place to fanes of prayer and praise.

  To-night we would bring our meed of praise
  To noble friends of darker days;
  The men and women crowned with light,
  The true and tried in our gloomy night.
  To Lundy, whose heart was early stirred
  To speak for freedom an earnest word;
  To Garrison, valiant, true and strong,
  Whose face was as flint against our wrong.

  And Phillips, the peerless, grand and brave,
  A tower of strength to the outcast slave.
  Earth has no marble too pure and white
  To enrol his name in golden light.
  Our Douglass, too, with his massive brain,
  Who plead our cause with his broken chain,
  And helped to hurl from his bloody seat
  The curse that writhed and died at his feet.


  78 THEN AND NOW.

  And Governor Andrew, who, looking back,
  Saw none he despised, though poor and black;
  And Harriet Beecher, whose glowing pen
  Corroded the chains of fettered men.
  To-night with greenest laurels we'll crown
  North Elba's grave where sleeps John Brown,
  Who made the gallows an altar high,
  And showed how a brave old man could die.
  And Lincoln, our martyred President,
  Who returned to his God with chains he had rent.*
  And Sumner, amid death's icy chill,
  Leaving to Hoar his Civil Rights Bill.
  And let us remember old underground,
  With all her passengers northward bound,
  The train that ran till it ceased to pay,
  With all her dividends given away.
  Nor let it be said that we have forgot
  The women who stood with Lucretia Mott;
  Nor her who to the world was known
  By the simple name of Lucy stone.
  A tribute unto a host of others
  Who knew that men though black were
        brothers,
  Who battled against our nation's sin,
  Whose graves are thick whose ranks are thin.
  Oh, people chastened in the fire,
  To nobler, grander things aspire;


  MACEO. 79

  In the new era of your life,
  Bring love for hate, and peace for strife;
  Upon your hearts this vow record
  That ye will build unto the Lord
  A nobler future, true and grand,
  To strengthen, crown and bless the land.
  A higher freedom ye may gain
  Than that which comes from a riven chain;
  Freedom your native land to bless
  With peace, and love and righteousness,
  As dreams that are past, a tale all told,
  Are the days when men were bought and sold;
  Now God be praised from sea to sea,
  Our flag floats o'er a country free.



  MACEO.

  Maceo dead! a thrill of sorrow
     Through our hearts in sadness ran
  When we felt in one sad hour
     That the world had lost a man.

  He had clasped unto his bosom
   The sad fortunes of his land--
  Held the cause for which he perished
     With a firm, unfaltering hand.


  80 MACEO.

  On his lips the name of freedom
     Fainted with his latest breath.
  Cuba Libre was his watchword
     Passing through the gates of death.

  With the light of God around us,
     Why this agony and strife?
  With the cross of Christ before us,
     Why this fearful waste of life?

  Must the pathway unto freedom
     Ever mark a crimson line,
  And the eyes of wayward mortals
     Always close to light divine?

  Must the hearts of fearless valor
     Fail 'mid crime and cruel wrong,
  When the world has read of heroes
     Brave and earnest, true and strong?

  Men to stay the floods of sorrow
     Sweeping round each war-crushed heart;
  Men to say to strife and carnage--
     From our world henceforth depart.

  God of peace and God of nations,
     Haste! oh, haste the glorious day


  MACEO. 81

  When the reign of our Redeemer
     O'er the world shall have its sway.

  When the swords now blood encrusted,
     Spears that reap the battle field,
  Shall be changed to higher service,
     Helping earth rich harvests yield.

  Where the widow weeps in anguish,
     And the orphan bows his head,
  Grant that peace and joy and gladness
     May like holy angels tread.

  Pity, oh, our God the sorrow
     Of thy world from thee astray,
  Lead us from the paths of madness
     Unto Christ the living way.

  Year by year the world grows weary
     'Neath its weight of sin and strife,
  Though the hands once pierced and bleeding
     Offer more abundant life.

  May the choral song of angels
     Heard upon Judea's plain
  Sound throughout the earth the tidings
     Of that old and sweet refrain.


  82 ONLY A WORD.

  Till our world, so sad and weary,
     Finds the balmy rest of peace--
  Peace to silence all her discords--
     Peace till war and crime shall cease.

  Peace to fall like gentle showers,
     Or on parchéd flowers dew,
  Till our hearts proclaim with gladness:
     Lo, He maketh all things new.



  "FISHERS OF MEN."

  I had a dream, a varied dream:
     Before my ravished sight
  The city of my Lord arose,
     With all its love and light.

  The music of a myriad harps
     Flowed out with sweet accord;
  And saints were casting down their crowns
     In homage to our Lord.


  "FISHERS OF MEN." 83

  My heart leaped up with untold joy,
     Life's toil and pain were o'er;
  My weary feet at last had found
     The bright and restful shore.

  Just as I reached the gates of light,
     Ready to enter in,
  From earth arose a fearful cry
     Of sorrow and of sin.

  I turned, and saw behind me surge
     A wild and stormy sea;
  And drowning men were reaching out
     Imploring hands to me.

  And ev'ry lip was blanched with dread,
     And moaning for relief;
  The music of the golden harps
     Grew fainter for their grief.

  Let me return, I quickly said,
     Close to the pearly gate;
  My work is with these wretched ones,
     So wrecked and desolate.

  An angel smiled and gently said:
     This is the gate of life,
  Wilt thou return to earth's sad scenes,
     Its weariness and strife,


  84 SIGNING THE PLEDGE.

  To comfort hearts that sigh and break,
     To dry the falling tear,
  Wilt thou forego the music sweet
     Entrancing now thy ear?

  I must return, I firmly said,
     The strugglers in that sea
  Shall not reach out beseeching hands
     In vain for help to me.

  I turned to go; but as I turned
     The gloomy sea grew bright,
  And from my heart there seemed to flow
     Ten thousand cords of light.

  And sin-wrecked men, with eager hands
     Did grasp each golden cord;
  And with my heart I drew them on
     To see my gracious Lord.

  Again I stood beside the gate.
     My heart was glad and free;
  For with me stood a rescued throng
     The Lord had given me.


  THE LOST BELLS. 85

  THE LOST BELLS.

  Year after year the artist wrought
     With earnest, loving care,
  The music flooding all his soul
     To pour upon the air.

  For this no metal was too rare,
     He counted not the cost;
  Nor deemed the years in which he toiled
     As labor vainly lost.

  When morning flushed with crimson light
     The golden gates of day,
  He longed to fill the air with chimes
     Sweet as a matin's lay.

  And when the sun was sinking low
     Within the distant West,
  He gladly heard the bells he wrought
     Herald the hour of rest.

  The music of a thousand harps
     Could never be so dear
  As when those solemn chants and thrills
     Fell on his list'ning ear.

  He poured his soul into their chimes,
     And felt his toil repaid;
  He called them children of his soul,
     His home a'near them made.


  86 THE LOST BELLS.

  But evil days came on apace,
     War spread his banner wide,
  And from his village snatched away
     The artist's love and pride.

  At dewy morn and stilly eve
     The chimes no more he heard;
  With dull and restless agony
     His spirit's depths was stirred.

  A weary longing filled his soul,
     It bound him like a spell;
  He left his home to seek the chimes--
     The chimes he loved so well.

  Where lofty fanes in grandeur rose,
     Upon his ear there fell
  No music like the long lost chimes
     Of his beloved bell.

  And thus he wandered year by year.
     Touched by the hand of time,
  Seeking to hear with anxious heart
     Each well remembered chime.

  And to that worn and weary heart
     There came a glad surcease:
  He heard again the dear old chimes,
     And smiled and uttered peace.


  THE LOST BELLS. 87

  "The chimes! the chimes!" the old man cried,
     "I hear their tones at last;"
  A sudden rapture filled his heart,
     And all his cares were past.

  Yes, peace had come with death's sweet calm,
     His journeying was o'er,
  The weary, restless wanderer
     Had reached the restful shore.

  It may be that he met again,
     Enfolded in the air,
  The dear old chimes beside the gates
     Where all is bright and fair;

  That he who crossed and bowed his head
     When Angelus was sung
  In clearer light touched golden harps
     By angel fingers strung.


  88 "DO NOT CHEER, MEN ARE DYING."

  "DO NOT CHEER, MEN ARE DYING," SAID
  CAPT. PHILLIPS, IN THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.

  Do not cheer, for men are dying
     From their distant homes in pain;
  And the restless sea is darkened
     By a flood of crimson rain.

  Do not cheer, for anxious mothers
     Wait and watch in lonely dread;
  Vainly waiting for the footsteps
     Never more their paths to tread.

  Do not cheer, while little children
     Gather round the widowed wife,
  Wondering why an unknown people
     Sought their own dear father's life.

  Do not cheer, for aged fathers
     Bend above their staves and weep,
  While the ocean sings the requiem
     Where their fallen children sleep.

  Do not cheer, for lips are paling
     On which lay the mother's kiss;
  'Mid the dreadful roar of battle
     How that mother's hand they miss!


  "DO NOT CHEER, MEN ARE DYING." 89

  Do not cheer: once joyous maidens,
     Who the mazy dance did tread,
  Bow their heads in bitter anguish,
     Mourning o'er their cherished dead.

  Do not cheer while maid and matron
     In this strife must bear a part;
  While the blow that strikes a soldier
     Reaches to some woman's heart.

  Do not cheer till arbitration
     O'er the nations holds its sway,
  And the century now closing
     Ushers in a brighter day.

  Do not cheer until the nation
     Shall more wise and thoughtful grow
  Than to staunch a stream of sorrow
     By an avalanche of woe.

  Do not cheer until each nation
     Sheathes the sword and blunts the spear,
  And we sing aloud for gladness:
     Lo, the reign of Christ is here,

  And the banners of destruction
     From the battlefield are furled,
  And the peace of God descending
     Rests upon a restless world.


  90 THE BURDENS OF ALL.

  THE BURDENS OF ALL.

  We may sigh o'er the heavy burdens
     Of the black, the brown and white;
  But if we all clasped hands together
     The burdens would be more light.
  How to solve life's saddest problems,
     Its weariness, want and woe,
  Was answered by One who suffered
     In Palestine long ago.

  He gave from his heart this precept,
     To ease the burdens of men,
  "As ye would that others do to you
     Do ye even so to them."
  Life's heavy, wearisome burdens
     Will change to a gracious trust
  When men shall learn in the light of God
     To be merciful and just.

  Where war has sharpened his weapons,
     And slavery masterful had,
  Let white and black and brown unite
     To build the kingdom of God.
  And never attempt in madness
     To build a kingdom or state,
  Through greed of gold or lust of power,
     On the crumbling stones of hate.

  The burdens will always he heavy,
     The sunshine fade into night,
  Till mercy and justice shall cement
     The black, the brown and the white.
  And earth shall answer with gladness,
     The herald angel's refrain,
  When "Peace on earth, good will to men"
     Was the burden of their strain.

       Will you feast with me, American People?
  But what have I that shall seem good to you!

  On my board are bitter apples
  And honey served on thorns,
  And in my flagons fluid iron,
  Hot from the crucibles.

  How should such fare entice you!

  THE GHETTO

  I

  Cool, inaccessible air
  Is floating in velvety blackness shot with steel-blue lights,
  But no breath stirs the heat
  Leaning its ponderous bulk upon the Ghetto
  And most on Hester street...

  The heat...
  Nosing in the body's overflow,
  Like a beast pressing its great steaming belly close,
  Covering all avenues of air...

  The heat in Hester street,
  Heaped like a dray
  With the garbage of the world.

  Bodies dangle from the fire escapes
  Or sprawl over the stoops...
  Upturned faces glimmer pallidly--
  Herring-yellow faces, spotted as with a mold,
  And moist faces of girls
  Like dank white lilies,
  And infants' faces with open parched mouths that suck at the air
       as at empty teats.

  Young women pass in groups,
  Converging to the forums and meeting halls,
  Surging indomitable, slow
  Through the gross underbrush of heat.
  Their heads are uncovered to the stars,
  And they call to the young men and to one another
  With a free camaraderie.
  Only their eyes are ancient and alone...

  The street crawls undulant,
  Like a river addled
  With its hot tide of flesh
  That ever thickens.
  Heavy surges of flesh
  Break over the pavements,
  Clavering like a surf--
  Flesh of this abiding
  Brood of those ancient mothers who saw the dawn break over Egypt...
  And turned their cakes upon the dry hot stones
  And went on
  Till the gold of the Egyptians fell down off their arms...
  Fasting and athirst...
  And yet on...

  Did they vision--with those eyes darkly clear,
  That looked the sun in the face and were not blinded--
  Across the centuries
  The march of their enduring flesh?
  Did they hear--
  Under the molten silence
  Of the desert like a stopped wheel--
  (And the scorpions tick-ticking on the sand...)
  The infinite procession of those feet?

  II

  I room at Sodos'--in the little green room that was Bennie's--
  With Sadie
  And her old father and her mother,
  Who is not so old and wears her own hair.

  Old Sodos no longer makes saddles.
  He has forgotten how.
  He has forgotten most things--even Bennie who stays away
       and sends wine on holidays--
  And he does not like Sadie's mother
  Who hides God's candles,
  Nor Sadie
  Whose young pagan breath puts out the light--
  That should burn always,
  Like Aaron's before the Lord.

  Time spins like a crazy dial in his brain,
  And night by night
  I see the love-gesture of his arm
  In its green-greasy coat-sleeve
  Circling the Book,
  And the candles gleaming starkly
  On the blotched-paper whiteness of his face,
  Like a miswritten psalm...
  Night by night
  I hear his lifted praise,
  Like a broken whinnying
  Before the Lord's shut gate.

  Sadie dresses in black.
  She has black-wet hair full of cold lights
  And a fine-drawn face, too white.
  All day the power machines
  Drone in her ears...
  All day the fine dust flies
  Till throats are parched and itch
  And the heat--like a kept corpse--
  Fouls to the last corner.

  Then--when needles move more slowly on the cloth
  And sweaty fingers slacken
  And hair falls in damp wisps over the eyes--
  Sped by some power within,
  Sadie quivers like a rod...
  A thin black piston flying,
  One with her machine.

  She--who stabs the piece-work with her bitter eye
  And bids the girls: "Slow down--
  You'll have him cutting us again!"
  She--fiery static atom,
  Held in place by the fierce pressure all about--
  Speeds up the driven wheels
  And biting steel--that twice
  Has nipped her to the bone.

  Nights, she reads
  Those books that have most unset thought,
  New-poured and malleable,
  To which her thought
  Leaps fusing at white heat,
  Or spits her fire out in some dim manger of a hall,
  Or at a protest meeting on the Square,
  Her lit eyes kindling the mob...
  Or dances madly at a festival.
  Each dawn finds her a little whiter,
  Though up and keyed to the long day,
  Alert, yet weary... like a bird
  That all night long has beat about a light.

  The Gentile lover, that she charms and shrews,
  Is one more pebble in the pack
  For Sadie's mother,
  Who greets him with her narrowed eyes
  That hold some welcome back.
  "What's to be done?" she'll say,
  "When Sadie wants she takes...
  Better than Bennie with his Christian woman...
  A man is not so like,
  If they should fight,
  To call her Jew..."

  Yet when she lies in bed
  And the soft babble of their talk comes to her
  And the silences...
  I know she never sleeps
  Till the keen draught blowing up the empty hall
  Edges through her transom
  And she hears his foot on the first stairs.

  Sarah and Anna live on the floor above.
  Sarah is swarthy and ill-dressed.
  Life for her has no ritual.
  She would break an ideal like an egg for the winged thing at the core.
  Her mind is hard and brilliant and cutting like an acetylene torch.
  If any impurities drift there, they must be burnt up as in a clear flame.
  It is droll that she should work in a pants factory.
  --Yet where else... tousled and collar awry at her olive throat.
  Besides her hands are unkempt.
  With English... and everything... there is so little time.
  She reads without bias--
  Doubting clamorously--
  Psychology, plays, science, philosophies--
  Those giant flowers that have bloomed and withered, scattering their seed...
  --And out of this young forcing soil what growth may come--
       what amazing blossomings.

  Anna is different.
  One is always aware of Anna, and the young men turn their heads
       to look at her.
  She has the appeal of a folk-song
  And her cheap clothes are always in rhythm.
  When the strike was on she gave half her pay.
  She would give anything--save the praise that is hers
  And the love of her lyric body.

  But Sarah's desire covets nothing apart.
  She would share all things...
  Even her lover.

  III

  The sturdy Ghetto children
  March by the parade,
  Waving their toy flags,
  Prancing to the bugles--
  Lusty, unafraid...
  Shaking little fire sticks
  At the night--
  The old blinking night--
  Swerving out of the way,
  Wrapped in her darkness like a shawl.

  But a small girl
  Cowers apart.
  Her braided head,
  Shiny as a black-bird's
  In the gleam of the torch-light,
  Is poised as for flight.
  Her eyes have the glow
  Of darkened lights.

  She stammers in Yiddish,
  But I do not understand,
  And there flits across her face
  A shadow
  As of a drawn blind.
  I give her an orange,
  Large and golden,
  And she looks at it blankly.
  I take her little cold hand and try to draw her to me,
  But she is stiff...
  Like a doll...

  Suddenly she darts through the crowd
  Like a little white panic
  Blown along the night--
  Away from the terror of oncoming feet...
  And drums rattling like curses in red roaring mouths...
  And torches spluttering silver fire
  And lights that nose out hiding-places...
  To the night--
  Squatting like a hunchback
  Under the curved stoop--
  The old mammy-night
  That has outlived beauty and knows the ways of fear--
  The night--wide-opening crooked and comforting arms,
  Hiding her as in a voluminous skirt.

  The sturdy Ghetto children
  March by the parade,
  Waving their toy flags,
  Prancing to the bugles,
  Lusty, unafraid.
  But I see a white frock
  And eyes like hooded lights
  Out of the shadow of pogroms
  Watching... watching...

  IV

  Calicoes and furs,
  Pocket-books and scarfs,
  Razor strops and knives
  (Patterns in check...)

  Olive hands and russet head,
  Pickles red and coppery,
  Green pickles, brown pickles,
  (Patterns in tapestry...)

  Coral beads, blue beads,
  Beads of pearl and amber,
  Gewgaws, beauty pins--
  Bijoutry for chits--
  Darting rays of violet,
  Amethyst and jade...
  All the colors out to play,
  Jumbled iridescently...
  (Patterns in stained glass
  Shivered into bits!)

  Nooses of gay ribbon
  Tugging at one's sleeve,
  Dainty little garters
  Hanging out their sign...
  Here a pout of frilly things--
  There a sonsy feather...
  (White beards, black beards
  Like knots in the weave...)

  And ah, the little babies--
  Shiny black-eyed babies--
  (Half a million pink toes
  Wriggling altogether.)
  Baskets full of babies
  Like grapes on a vine.

  Mothers waddling in and out,
  Making all things right--
  Picking up the slipped threads
  In Grand street at night--
  Grand street like a great bazaar,
  Crowded like a float,
  Bulging like a crazy quilt
  Stretched on a line.

  But nearer seen
  This litter of the East
  Takes on a garbled majesty.

  The herded stalls
  In dissolute array...
  The glitter and the jumbled finery
  And strangely juxtaposed
  Cans, paper, rags
  And colors decomposing,
  Faded like old hair,
  With flashes of barbaric hues
  And eyes of mystery...
  Flung
  Like an ancient tapestry of motley weave
  Upon the open wall of this new land.

  Here, a tawny-headed girl...
  Lemons in a greenish broth
  And a huge earthen bowl
  By a bronzed merchant
  With a tall black lamb's wool cap upon his head...
  He has no glance for her.
  His thrifty eyes
  Bend--glittering, intent
  Their hoarded looks
  Upon his merchandise,
  As though it were some splendid cloth
  Or sumptuous raiment
  Stitched in gold and red...

  He seldom talks
  Save of the goods he spreads--
  The meager cotton with its dismal flower--
  But with his skinny hands
  That hover like two hawks
  Above some luscious meat,
  He fingers lovingly each calico,
  As though it were a gorgeous shawl,
  Or costly vesture
  Wrought in silken thread,
  Or strange bright carpet
  Made for sandaled feet...

  Here an old grey scholar stands.
  His brooding eyes--
  That hold long vistas without end
  Of caravans and trees and roads,
  And cities dwindling in remembrance--
  Bend mostly on his tapes and thread.

  What if they tweak his beard--
  These raw young seed of Israel
  Who have no backward vision in their eyes--
  And mock him as he sways
  Above the sunken arches of his feet--
  They find no peg to hang their taunts upon.
  His soul is like a rock
  That bears a front worn smooth
  By the coarse friction of the sea,
  And, unperturbed, he keeps his bitter peace.

  What if a rigid arm and stuffed blue shape,
  Backed by a nickel star
  Does prod him on,
  Taking his proud patience for humility...
  All gutters are as one
  To that old race that has been thrust
  From off the curbstones of the world...
  And he smiles with the pale irony
  Of one who holds
  The wisdom of the Talmud stored away
  In his mind's lavender.

  But this young trader,
  Born to trade as to a caul,
  Peddles the notions of the hour.
  The gestures of the craft are his
  And all the lore
  As when to hold, withdraw, persuade, advance...
  And be it gum or flags,
  Or clean-all or the newest thing in tags,
  Demand goes to him as the bee to flower.
  And he--appraising
  All who come and go
  With his amazing
  Slight-of-mind and glance
  And nimble thought
  And nature balanced like the scales at nought--
  Looks Westward where the trade-lights glow,
  And sees his vision rise--
  A tape-ruled vision,
  Circumscribed in stone--
  Some fifty stories to the skies.

  V

  As I sit in my little fifth-floor room--
  Bare,
  Save for bed and chair,
  And coppery stains
  Left by seeping rains
  On the low ceiling
  And green plaster walls,
  Where when night falls
  Golden lady-bugs
  Come out of their holes,
  And roaches, sepia-brown, consort...
  I hear bells pealing
  Out of the gray church at Rutgers street,
  Holding its high-flung cross above the Ghetto,
  And, one floor down across the court,
  The parrot screaming:
  Vorwärts... Vorwärts...

  The parrot frowsy-white,
  Everlastingly swinging
  On its iron bar.

  A little old woman,
  With a wig of smooth black hair
  Gummed about her shrunken brows,
  Comes sometimes on the fire escape.
  An old stooped mother,
  The left shoulder low
  With that uneven droopiness that women know
  Who have suckled many young...
  Yet I have seen no other than the parrot there.

  I watch her mornings as she shakes her rugs
  Feebly, with futile reach
  And fingers without clutch.
  Her thews are slack
  And curved the ruined back
  And flesh empurpled like old meat,
  Yet each conspires
  To feed those guttering fires
  With which her eyes are quick.

  On Friday nights
  Her candles signal
  Infinite fine rays
  To other windows,
  Coupling other lights,
  Linking the tenements
  Like an endless prayer.

  She seems less lonely than the bird
  That day by day about the dismal house
  Screams out his frenzied word...
  That night by night--
  If a dog yelps
  Or a cat yawls
  Or a sick child whines,
  Or a door screaks on its hinges,
  Or a man and woman fight--
  Sends his cry above the huddled roofs:
  Vorwärts... Vorwärts...

  VI

  In this dingy cafe
  The old men sit muffled in woollens.
  Everything is faded, shabby, colorless, old...
  The chairs, loose-jointed,
  Creaking like old bones--
  The tables, the waiters, the walls,
  Whose mottled plaster
  Blends in one tone with the old flesh.

  Young life and young thought are alike barred,
  And no unheralded noises jolt old nerves,
  And old wheezy breaths
  Pass around old thoughts, dry as snuff,
  And there is no divergence and no friction
  Because life is flattened and ground as by many mills.

  And it is here the Committee--
  Sweet-breathed and smooth of skin
  And supple of spine and knee,
  With shining unpouched eyes
  And the blood, high-powered,
  Leaping in flexible arteries--
  The insolent, young, enthusiastic, undiscriminating Committee,
  Who would placard tombstones
  And scatter leaflets even in graves,
  Comes trampling with sacrilegious feet!

  The old men turn stiffly,
  Mumbling to each other.
  They are gentle and torpid and busy with eating.
  But one lifts a face of clayish pallor,
  There is a dull fury in his eyes, like little rusty grates.
  He rises slowly,
  Trembling in his many swathings like an awakened mummy,
  Ridiculous yet terrible.
  --And the Committee flings him a waste glance,
  Dropping a leaflet by his plate.

  A lone fire flickers in the dusty eyes.
  The lips chant inaudibly.
  The warped shrunken body straightens like a tree.
  And he curses...
  With uplifted arms and perished fingers,
  Claw-like, clutching...
  So centuries ago
  The old men cursed Acosta,
  When they, prophetic, heard upon their sepulchres
  Those feet that may not halt nor turn aside for ancient things.

  VII

  Here in this room, bare like a barn,
  Egos gesture one to the other--
  Naked, unformed, unwinged
  Egos out of the shell,
  Examining, searching, devouring--
  Avid alike for the flower or the dung...
  (Having no dainty antennae for the touch and withdrawal--
  Only the open maw...)

  Egos cawing,
  Expanding in the mean egg...
  Little squat tailors with unkempt faces,
  Pale as lard,
  Fur-makers, factory-hands, shop-workers,
  News-boys with battling eyes
  And bodies yet vibrant with the momentum of long runs,
  Here and there a woman...

  Words, words, words,
  Pattering like hail,
  Like hail falling without aim...
  Egos rampant,
  Screaming each other down.
  One motions perpetually,
  Waving arms like overgrowths.
  He has burning eyes and a cough
  And a thin voice piping
  Like a flute among trombones.

  One, red-bearded, rearing
  A welter of maimed face bashed in from some old wound,
  Garbles Max Stirner.
  His words knock each other like little wooden blocks.
  No one heeds him,
  And a lank boy with hair over his eyes
  Pounds upon the table.
  --He is chairman.

  Egos yet in the primer,
  Hearing world-voices
  Chanting grand arias...
  Majors resonant,
  Stunning with sound...
  Baffling minors
  Half-heard like rain on pools...
  Majestic discordances
  Greater than harmonies...
  --Gleaning out of it all
  Passion, bewilderment, pain...

  Egos yearning with the world-old want in their eyes--
  Hurt hot eyes that do not sleep enough...
  Striving with infinite effort,
  Frustrate yet ever pursuing
  The great white Liberty,
  Trailing her dissolving glory over each hard-won barricade--
  Only to fade anew...

  Egos crying out of unkempt deeps
  And waving their dreams like flags--
  Multi-colored dreams,
  Winged and glorious...

  A gas jet throws a stunted flame,
  Vaguely illumining the groping faces.
  And through the uncurtained window
  Falls the waste light of stars,
  As cold as wise men's eyes...
  Indifferent great stars,
  Fortuitously glancing
  At the secret meeting in this shut-in room,
  Bare as a manger.

  VIII

  Lights go out
  And the stark trunks of the factories
  Melt into the drawn darkness,
  Sheathing like a seamless garment.

  And mothers take home their babies,
  Waxen and delicately curled,
  Like little potted flowers closed under the stars.

  Lights go out
  And the young men shut their eyes,
  But life turns in them...

  Life in the cramped ova
  Tearing and rending asunder its living cells...
  Wars, arts, discoveries, rebellions, travails, immolations,
       cataclysms, hates...
  Pent in the shut flesh.
  And the young men twist on their beds in languor and dizziness
       unsupportable...
  Their eyes--heavy and dimmed
  With dust of long oblivions in the gray pulp behind--
  Staring as through a choked glass.
  And they gaze at the moon--throwing off a faint heat--
  The moon, blond and burning, creeping to their cots
  Softly, as on naked feet...
  Lolling on the coverlet... like a woman offering her white body.

  Nude glory of the moon!
  That leaps like an athlete on the bosoms of the young girls stripped
       of their linens;
  Stroking their breasts that are smooth and cool as mother-of-pearl
  Till the nipples tingle and burn as though little lips plucked at them.
  They shudder and grow faint.
  And their ears are filled as with a delirious rhapsody,
  That Life, like a drunken player,
  Strikes out of their clear white bodies
  As out of ivory keys.

  Lights go out...
  And the great lovers linger in little groups, still passionately debating,
  Or one may walk in silence, listening only to the still summons of Life--
  Life making the great Demand...
  Calling its new Christs...
  Till tears come, blurring the stars
  That grow tender and comforting like the eyes of comrades;
  And the moon rolls behind the Battery
  Like a word molten out of the mouth of God.

  Lights go out...
  And colors rush together,
  Fusing and floating away...
  Pale worn gold like the settings of old jewels...
  Mauves, exquisite, tremulous, and luminous purples
  And burning spires in aureoles of light
  Like shimmering auras.

  They are covering up the pushcarts...
  Now all have gone save an old man with mirrors--
  Little oval mirrors like tiny pools.
  He shuffles up a darkened street
  And the moon burnishes his mirrors till they shine like phosphorus...
  The moon like a skull,
  Staring out of eyeless sockets at the old men trundling home the pushcarts.

  IX

  A sallow dawn is in the sky
  As I enter my little green room.
  Sadie's light is still burning...
  Without, the frail moon
  Worn to a silvery tissue,
  Throws a faint glamour on the roofs,
  And down the shadowy spires
  Lights tip-toe out...
  Softly as when lovers close street doors.

  Out of the Battery
  A little wind
  Stirs idly--as an arm
  Trails over a boat's side in dalliance--
  Rippling the smooth dead surface of the heat,
  And Hester street,
  Like a forlorn woman over-born
  By many babies at her teats,
  Turns on her trampled bed to meet the day.

  LIFE!
  Startling, vigorous life,
  That squirms under my touch,
  And baffles me when I try to examine it,
  Or hurls me back without apology.
  Leaving my ego ruffled and preening itself.

  Life,
  Articulate, shrill,
  Screaming in provocative assertion,
  Or out of the black and clotted gutters,
  Piping in silvery thin
  Sweet staccato
  Of children's laughter,

  Or clinging over the pushcarts
  Like a litter of tiny bells
  Or the jingle of silver coins,
  Perpetually changing hands,
  Or like the Jordan somberly
  Swirling in tumultuous uncharted tides,
  Surface-calm.

  Electric currents of life,
  Throwing off thoughts like sparks,
  Glittering, disappearing,
  Making unknown circuits,
  Or out of spent particles stirring
  Feeble contortions in old faiths
  Passing before the new.

  Long nights argued away
  In meeting halls
  Back of interminable stairways--
  In Roumanian wine-shops
  And little Russian tea-rooms...

  Feet echoing through deserted streets
  In the soft darkness before dawn...
  Brows aching, throbbing, burning--
  Life leaping in the shaken flesh
  Like flame at an asbestos curtain.

  Life--
  Pent, overflowing
  Stoops and façades,
  Jostling, pushing, contriving,
  Seething as in a great vat...

  Bartering, changing, extorting,
  Dreaming, debating, aspiring,
  Astounding, indestructible
  Life of the Ghetto...

  Strong flux of life,
  Like a bitter wine
  Out of the bloody stills of the world...
  Out of the Passion eternal.


  MANHATTAN LIGHTS

  MANHATTAN

  Out of the night you burn, Manhattan,
  In a vesture of gold--
  Span of innumerable arcs,
  Flaring and multiplying--
  Gold at the uttermost circles fading
  Into the tenderest hint of jade,
  Or fusing in tremulous twilight blues,
  Robing the far-flung offices,
  Scintillant-storied, forking flame,
  Or soaring to luminous amethyst
  Over the steeples aureoled--

  Diaphanous gold,
  Veiling the Woolworth, argently
  Rising slender and stark
  Mellifluous-shrill as a vender's cry,
  And towers squatting graven and cold
  On the velvet bales of the dark,
  And the Singer's appraising
  Indolent idol's eye,
  And night like a purple cloth unrolled--

  Nebulous gold
  Throwing an ephemeral glory about life's vanishing points,
  Wherein you burn...
  You of unknown voltage
  Whirling on your axis...
  Scrawling vermillion signatures
  Over the night's velvet hoarding...
  Insolent, towering spherical
  To apices ever shifting.

  BROADWAY

  Light!
  Innumerable ions of light,
  Kindling, irradiating,
  All to their foci tending...

  Light that jingles like anklet chains
  On bevies of little lithe twinkling feet,
  Or clingles in myriad vibrations
  Like trillions of porcelain
  Vases shattering...

  Light over the laminae of roofs,
  Diffusing in shimmering nebulae
  About the night's boundaries,
  Or billowing in pearly foam
  Submerging the low-lying stars...

  Light for the feast prolonged--
  Captive light in the goblets quivering...
  Sparks evanescent
  Struck of meeting looks--
  Fringed eyelids leashing
  Sheathed and leaping lights...
  Infinite bubbles of light
  Bursting, reforming...
  Silvery filings of light
  Incessantly falling...
  Scintillant, sided dust of light
  Out of the white flares of Broadway--
  Like a great spurious diamond
  In the night's corsage faceted...

  Broadway,
  In ambuscades of light,
  Drawing the charmed multitudes
  With the slow suction of her breath--
  Dangling her naked soul
  Behind the blinding gold of eunuch lights
  That wind about her like a bodyguard.

  Or like a huge serpent, iridescent-scaled,
  Trailing her coruscating length
  Over the night prostrate--
  Triumphant poised,
  Her hydra heads above the avenues,
  Values appraising
  And her avid eyes
  Glistening with eternal watchfulness...

  Broadway--
  Out of her towers rampant,
  Like an unsubtle courtezan
  Reserving nought for some adventurous night.

  FLOTSAM

  Crass rays streaming from the vestibules;
  Cafes glittering like jeweled teeth;
  High-flung signs
  Blinking yellow phosphorescent eyes;
  Girls in black
  Circling monotonously
  About the orange lights...

  Nothing to guess at...
  Save the darkness above
  Crouching like a great cat.

  In the dim-lit square,
  Where dishevelled trees
  Tustle with the wind--the wind like a scythe
  Mowing their last leaves--
  Arcs shimmering through a greenish haze--
  Pale oval arcs
  Like ailing virgins,
  Each out of a halo circumscribed,
  Pallidly staring...

  Figures drift upon the benches
  With no more rustle than a dropped leaf settling--
  Slovenly figures like untied parcels,
  And papers wrapped about their knees
  Huddled one to the other,
  Cringing to the wind--
  The sided wind,
  Leaving no breach untried...

  So many and all so still...
  The fountain slobbering its stone basin
  Is louder than They--
  Flotsam of the five oceans
  Here on this raft of the world.

  This old man's head
  Has found a woman's shoulder.
  The wind juggles with her shawl
  That flaps about them like a sail,
  And splashes her red faded hair
  Over the salt stubble of his chin.
  A light foam is on his lips,
  As though dreams surged in him
  Breaking and ebbing away...
  And the bare boughs shuffle above him
  And the twigs rattle like dice...

  She--diffused like a broken beetle--
  Sprawls without grace,
  Her face gray as asphalt,
  Her jaws sagging as on loosened hinges...
  Shadows ply about her mouth--
  Nimble shadows out of the jigging tree,
  That dances above her its dance of dry bones.

  II

  A uniformed front,
  Paunched;
  A glance like a blow,
  The swing of an arm,
  Verved, vigorous;
  Boot-heels clanking
  In metallic rhythm;
  The blows of a baton,
  Quick, staccato...

  --There is a rustling along the benches
  As of dried leaves raked over...
  And the old man lifts a shaking palsied hand,
  Tucking the displaced paper about his knees.

  Colder...
  And a frost under foot,
  Acid, corroding,
  Eating through worn bootsoles.

  Drab forms blur into greenish vapor.
  Through boughs like cross-bones,
  Pale arcs flare and shiver
  Like lilies in a wind.

  High over Broadway
  A far-flung sign
  Glitters in indigo darkness
  And spurts again rhythmically,
  Spraying great drops
  Red as a hemorrhage.

  SPRING

  A spring wind on the Bowery,
  Blowing the fluff of night shelters
  Off bedraggled garments,
  And agitating the gutters, that eject little spirals of vapor
  Like lewd growths.

  Bare-legged children stamp in the puddles, splashing each other,
  One--with a choir-boy's face
  Twits me as I pass...
  The word, like a muddied drop,
  Seems to roll over and not out of
  The bowed lips,
  Yet dewy red
  And sweetly immature.

  People sniff the air with an upward look--
  Even the mite of a girl
  Who never plays...
  Her mother smiles at her
  With eyes like vacant lots
  Rimming vistas of mean streets
  And endless washing days...
  Yet with sun on the lines
  And a drying breeze.

  The old candy woman
  Shivers in the young wind.
  Her eyes--littered with memories
  Like ancient garrets,
  Or dusty unaired rooms where someone died--
  Ask nothing of the spring.

  But a pale pink dream
  Trembles about this young girl's body,
  Draping it like a glowing aura.

  She gloats in a mirror
  Over her gaudy hat,
  With its flower God never thought of...

  And the dream, unrestrained,
  Floats about the loins of a soldier,
  Where it quivers a moment,
  Warming to a crimson
  Like the scarf of a toreador...

  But the delicate gossamer breaks at his contact
  And recoils to her in strands of shattered rose.

  BOWERY AFTERNOON

  Drab discoloration
  Of faces, façades, pawn-shops,
  Second-hand clothing,
  Smoky and fly-blown glass of lunch-rooms,
  Odors of rancid life...

  Deadly uniformity
  Of eyes and windows
  Alike devoid of light...
  Holes wherein life scratches--
  Mangy life
  Nosing to the gutter's end...

  Show-rooms and mimic pillars
  Flaunting out of their gaudy vestibules
  Bosoms and posturing thighs...

  Over all the Elevated
  Droning like a bloated fly.

  PROMENADE

       Undulant rustlings,
       Of oncoming silk,
       Rhythmic, incessant,
       Like the motion of leaves...
       Fragments of color
       In glowing surprises...
       Pink inuendoes
       Hooded in gray
       Like buds in a cobweb
       Pearled at dawn...
       Glimpses of green
       And blurs of gold
       And delicate mauves
       That snatch at youth...
       And bodies all rosily
       Fleshed for the airing,
       In warm velvety surges
       Passing imperious, slow...

  Women drift into the limousines
  That shut like silken caskets
  On gems half weary of their glittering...
  Lamps open like pale moon flowers...
  Arcs are radiant opals
  Strewn along the dusk...
  No common lights invade.
  And spires rise like litanies--
  Magnificats of stone
  Over the white silence of the arcs,
  Burning in perpetual adoration.

  THE FOG

  Out of the lamp-bestarred and clouded dusk--
  Snaring, illuding, concealing,
  Magically conjuring--
  Turning to fairy-coaches
  Beetle-backed limousines
  Scampering under the great Arch--
  Making a decoy of blue overalls
  And mystery of a scarlet shawl--
  Indolently--
  Knowing no impediment of its sure advance--
  Descends the fog.

  FACES

  A late snow beats
  With cold white fists upon the tenements--
  Hurriedly drawing blinds and shutters,
  Like tall old slatterns
  Pulling aprons about their heads.

  Lights slanting out of Mott Street
  Gibber out,
  Or dribble through bar-room slits,
  Anonymous shapes
  Conniving behind shuttered panes
  Caper and disappear...
  Where the Bowery
  Is throbbing like a fistula
  Back of her ice-scabbed fronts.

  Livid faces
  Glimmer in furtive doorways,
  Or spill out of the black pockets of alleys,
  Smears of faces like muddied beads,
  Making a ghastly rosary
  The night mumbles over
  And the snow with its devilish and silken whisper...
  Patrolling arcs
  Blowing shrill blasts over the Bread Line
  Stalk them as they pass,
  Silent as though accouched of the darkness,
  And the wind noses among them,
       Like a skunk
  That roots about the heart...

  Colder:
  And the Elevated slams upon the silence
  Like a ponderous door.
  Then all is still again,
  Save for the wind fumbling over
  The emptily swaying faces--
  The wind rummaging
  Like an old Jew...

  Faces in glimmering rows...
  (No sign of the abject life--
  Not even a blasphemy...)
  But the spindle legs keep time
  To a limping rhythm,
  And the shadows twitch upon the snow
       Convulsively--
  As though death played
  With some ungainly dolls.


  LABOR

  DEBRIS

  I love those spirits
  That men stand off and point at,
  Or shudder and hood up their souls--
  Those ruined ones,
  Where Liberty has lodged an hour
  And passed like flame,
  Bursting asunder the too small house.

  DEDICATION

  I would be a torch unto your hand,
  A lamp upon your forehead, Labor,
  In the wild darkness before the Dawn
  That I shall never see...

  We shall advance together, my Beloved,
  Awaiting the mighty ushering...
  Together we shall make the last grand charge
  And ride with gorgeous Death
  With all her spangles on
  And cymbals clashing...
  And you shall rush on exultant as I fall--
  Scattering a brief fire about your feet...

  Let it be so...
  Better--while life is quick
  And every pain immense and joy supreme,
  And all I have and am
  Flames upward to the dream...
  Than like a taper forgotten in the dawn,
  Burning out the wick.

  THE SONG OF IRON

  I

  Not yet hast Thou sounded
  Thy clangorous music,
  Whose strings are under the mountains...
  Not yet hast Thou spoken
  The blooded, implacable Word...

  But I hear in the Iron singing--
  In the triumphant roaring of the steam and pistons pounding--
  Thy barbaric exhortation...
  And the blood leaps in my arteries, unreproved,
  Answering Thy call...
  All my spirit is inundated with the tumultuous passion of Thy Voice,
  And sings exultant with the Iron,
  For now I know I too am of Thy Chosen...

  Oh fashioned in fire--
  Needing flame for Thy ultimate word--
  Behold me, a cupola
  Poured to Thy use!

  Heed not my tremulous body
  That faints in the grip of Thy gauntlet.
  Break it... and cast it aside...
  But make of my spirit
  That dares and endures
  Thy crucible...
  Pour through my soul
  Thy molten, world-whelming song.

  ... Here at Thy uttermost gate
  Like a new Mary, I wait...

  II

  Charge the blast furnace, workman...
  Open the valves--
  Drive the fires high...
  (Night is above the gates).

  How golden-hot the ore is
  From the cupola spurting,
  Tossing the flaming petals
  Over the silt and furnace ash--
  Blown leaves, devastating,
  Falling about the world...

  Out of the furnace mouth--
  Out of the giant mouth--
  The raging, turgid, mouth--
  Fall fiery blossoms
  Gold with the gold of buttercups
  In a field at sunset,
  Or huskier gold of dandelions,
  Warmed in sun-leavings,
  Or changing to the paler hue
  At the creamy hearts of primroses.

  Charge the converter, workman--
  Tired from the long night?
  But the earth shall suck up darkness--
  The earth that holds so much...
  And out of these molten flowers,
  Shall shape the heavy fruit...

  Then open the valves--
  Drive the fires high,
  Your blossoms nurturing.
  (Day is at the gates
  And a young wind...)

  Put by your rod, comrade,
  And look with me, shading your eyes...
  Do you not see--
  Through the lucent haze
  Out of the converter rising--
  In the spirals of fire
  Smiting and blinding,
  A shadowy shape
  White as a flame of sacrifice,
  Like a lily swaying?

  III

  The ore leaping in the crucibles,
  The ore communicant,
  Sending faint thrills along the leads...
  Fire is running along the roots of the mountains...
  I feel the long recoil of earth
  As under a mighty quickening...
  (Dawn is aglow in the light of the Iron...)
  All palpitant, I wait...


  IV

  Here ye, Dictators--late Lords of the Iron,
  Shut in your council rooms, palsied, depowered--
  The blooded, implacable Word?
  Not whispered in cloture, one to the other,
  (Brother in fear of the fear of his brother...)
  But chanted and thundered
  On the brazen, articulate tongues of the Iron
  Babbling in flame...

  Sung to the rhythm of prisons dismantled,
  Manacles riven and ramparts defaced...
  (Hearts death-anointed yet hearing life calling...)
  Ankle chains bursting and gallows unbraced...

  Sung to the rhythm of arsenals burning...
  Clangor of iron smashing on iron,
  Turmoil of metal and dissonant baying
  Of mail-sided monsters shattered asunder...

  Hulks of black turbines all mangled and roaring,
  Battering egress through ramparted walls...
  Mouthing of engines, made rabid with power,
  Into the holocaust snorting and plunging...

  Mighty converters torn from their axis,
  Flung to the furnaces, vomiting fire,
  Jumbled in white-heaten masses disshapen...
  Writhing in flame-tortured levers of iron...

  Gnashing of steel serpents twisting and dying...
  Screeching of steam-glutted cauldrons rending...
  Shock of leviathans prone on each other...
  Scaled flanks touching, ore entering ore...
  Steel haunches closing and grappling and swaying
  In the waltz of the mating locked mammoths of iron,
  Tasting the turbulent fury of living,
  Mad with a moment's exuberant living!
  Crash of devastating hammers despoiling..
  Hands inexorable, marring
  What hands had so cunningly moulded...

  Structures of steel welded, subtily tempered,
  Marvelous wrought of the wizards of ore,
  Torn into octaves discordantly clashing,
  Chords never final but onward progressing
  In monstrous fusion of sound ever smiting on sound
       in mad vortices whirling...

  Till the ear, tortured, shrieks for cessation
  Of the raving inharmonies hatefully mingling...
  The fierce obligato the steel pipes are screaming...
  The blare of the rude molten music of Iron...

  FRANK LITTLE AT CALVARY

  I

  He walked under the shadow of the Hill
  Where men are fed into the fires
  And walled apart...
  Unarmed and alone,
  He summoned his mates from the pit's mouth
  Where tools rested on the floors
  And great cranes swung
  Unemptied, on the iron girders.
  And they, who were the Lords of the Hill,
  Were seized with a great fear,
  When they heard out of the silence of wheels
  The answer ringing
  In endless reverberations
  Under the mountain...

  So they covered up their faces
  And crept upon him as he slept...
  Out of eye-holes in black cloth
  They looked upon him who had flung
  Between them and their ancient prey
  The frail barricade of his life...
  And when night--that has connived at so much--
  Was heavy with the unborn day,
  They haled him from his bed...

  Who might know of that wild ride?
  Only the bleak Hill--
  The red Hill, vigilant,
  Like a blood-shot eye
  In the black mask of night--
  Dared watch them as they raced
  By each blind-folded street
  Godiva might have ridden down...
  But when they stopped beside the Place,
  I know he turned his face
  Wistfully to the accessory night...

  And when he saw--against the sky,
  Sagged like a silken net
  Under its load of stars--
  The black bridge poised
  Like a gigantic spider motionless...
  I know there was a silence in his heart,
  As of a frozen sea,
  Where some half lifted arm, mid-way
  Wavers, and drops heavily...

  I know he waved to life,
  And that life signaled back, transcending space,
  To each high-powered sense,
  So that he missed no gesture of the wind
  Drawing the shut leaves close...
  So that he saw the light on comrades' faces
  Of camp fires out of sight...
  And the savor of meat and bread
  Blew in his nostrils... and the breath
  Of unrailed spaces
  Where shut wild clover smelled as sweet
  As a virgin in her bed.

  I know he looked once at America,
  Quiescent, with her great flanks on the globe,
  And once at the skies whirling above him...
  Then all that he had spoken against
  And struck against and thrust against
  Over the frail barricade of his life
  Rushed between him and the stars...

  II

  Life thunders on...
  Over the black bridge
  The line of lighted cars
  Creeps like a monstrous serpent
  Spooring gold...

  Watchman, what of the track?

  Night... silence... stars...
  All's Well!

  III

  Light...
  (Breaking mists...
  Hills gliding like hands out of a slipping hold...)
  Light over the pit mouths,
  Streaming in tenuous rays down the black gullets of the Hill...
  (The copper, insensate, sleeping in the buried lode.)
  Light...
  Forcing the clogged windows of arsenals...
  Probing with long sentient fingers in the copper chips...
  Gleaming metallic and cold
  In numberless slivers of steel...
  Light over the trestles and the iron clips
  Of the black bridge--poised like a gigantic spider motionless--
  Sweet inquisition of light, like a child's wonder...
  Intrusive, innocently staring light
  That nothing appals...

  Light in the slow fumbling summer leaves,
  Cooing and calling
  All winged and avid things
  Waking the early flies, keen to the scent...
  Green-jeweled iridescent flies
  Unerringly steering--
  Swarming over the blackened lips,
  The young day sprays with indiscriminate gold...

  Watchman, what of the Hill?

  Wheels turn;
  The laden cars
  Go rumbling to the mill,
  And Labor walks beside the mules...
  All's Well with the Hill!

  SPIRES

  Spires of Grace Church,
  For you the workers of the world
  Travailed with the mountains...
  Aborting their own dreams
  Till the dream of you arose--
  Beautiful, swaddled in stone--
  Scorning their hands.

  THE LEGION OF IRON

  They pass through the great iron gates--
  Men with eyes gravely discerning,
  Skilled to appraise the tunnage of cranes
  Or split an inch into thousandths--
  Men tempered by fire as the ore is
  And planned to resistance
  Like steel that has cooled in the trough;
  Silent of purpose, inflexible, set to fulfilment--
  To conquer, withstand, overthrow...
  Men mannered to large undertakings,
  Knowing force as a brother
  And power as something to play with,
  Seeing blood as a slip of the iron,
  To be wiped from the tools
  Lest they rust.

  But what if they stood aside,
  Who hold the earth so careless in the crook of their arms?

  What of the flamboyant cities
  And the lights guttering out like candles in a wind...
  And the armies halted...
  And the train mid-way on the mountain
  And idle men chaffing across the trenches...
  And the cursing and lamentation
  And the clamor for grain shut in the mills of the world?
  What if they stayed apart,
  Inscrutably smiling,
  Leaving the ground encumbered with dead wire
  And the sea to row-boats
  And the lands marooned--
  Till Time should like a paralytic sit,
  A mildewed hulk above the nations squatting?

  FUEL

  What of the silence of the keys
  And silvery hands? The iron sings...
  Though bows lie broken on the strings,
  The fly-wheels turn eternally...

  Bring fuel--drive the fires high...
  Throw all this artist-lumber in
  And foolish dreams of making things...
  (Ten million men are called to die.)

  As for the common men apart,
  Who sweat to keep their common breath,
  And have no hour for books or art--
  What dreams have these to hide from death!

  A TOAST

  Not your martyrs anointed of heaven--
       The ages are red where they trod--
  But the Hunted--the world's bitter leaven--
       Who smote at your imbecile God--

  A being to pander and fawn to,
       To propitiate, flatter and dread
  As a thing that your souls are in pawn to,
       A Dealer who traffics the dead;

  A Trader with greed never sated,
       Who barters the souls in his snares,
  That were trapped in the lusts he created,
       For incense and masses and prayers--

  They are crushed in the coils of your halters;
       'Twere well--by the creeds ye have nursed--
  That ye send up a cry from your altars,
       A mass for the Martyrs Accursed;

  A passionate prayer from reprieval
       For the Brotherhood not understood--
  For the Heroes who died for the evil,
       Believing the evil was good.

  To the Breakers, the Bold, the Despoilers,
       Who dreamed of a world over-thrown...
  They who died for the millions of toilers--
       Few--fronting the nations alone!

  --To the Outlawed of men and the Branded,
       Whether hated or hating they fell--
  I pledge the devoted, red-handed,
       Unfaltering Heroes of Hell!


  ACCIDENTALS

  "THE EVERLASTING RETURN"

  It is dark... so dark, I remember the sun on Chios...
  It is still... so still, I hear the beat of our paddles on the Aegean...

  Ten times we had watched the moon
  Rise like a thin white virgin out of the waters
  And round into a full maternity...
  For thrice ten moons we had touched no flesh
  Save the man flesh on either hand
  That was black and bitter and salt and scaled by the sea.

  The Athenian boy sat on my left...
  His hair was yellow as corn steeped in wine...
  And on my right was Phildar the Carthaginian,
  Grinning Phildar
  With his mouth pulled taut as by reins from his black gapped teeth.
  Many a whip had coiled about him
  And his shoulders were rutted deep as wet ground under chariot wheels,
  And his skin was red and tough as a bull's hide cured in the sun.
  He did not sing like the other slaves,
  But when a big wind came up he screamed with it.
  And always he looked out to sea,
  Save when he tore at his fish ends
  Or spat across me at the Greek boy, whose mouth was red and apart
       like an opened fruit.

  We had rowed from dawn and the green galley hard at our stern.
  She was green and squat and skulked close to the sea.
  All day the tish of their paddles had tickled our ears,
  And when night came on
  And little naked stars dabbled in the water
  And half the crouching moon
  Slid over the silver belly of the sea thick-scaled with light,
  We heard them singing at their oars...
  We who had no breath for song.

  There was no sound in our boat
  Save the clingle of wrist chains
  And the sobbing of the young Greek.
  I cursed him that his hair blew in my mouth, tasting salt of the sea...
  I cursed him that his oar kept ill time...
  When he looked at me I cursed him again,
  That his eyes were soft as a woman's.

  How long... since their last shell gouged our batteries?
  How long... since we rose at aim with a sleuth moon astern?
  (It was the damned green moon that nosed us out...
  The moon that flushed our periscope till it shone like a silver flame...)

  They loosed each man's right hand
  As the galley spent on our decks...
  And amazed and bloodied we reared half up
  And fought askew with the left hand shackled...
  But a zigzag fire leapt in our sockets
  And knotted our thews like string...
  Our thews grown stiff as a crooked spine that would not straighten...

  How long... since our gauges fell
  And the sea shoved us under?
  It is dark... so dark...
  Darkness presses hairy-hot
  Where three make crowded company...
  And the rank steel smells....
  It is still... so still...
  I seem to hear the wind
  On the dimpled face of the water fathoms above...


  It was still... so still... we three that were left alive
  Stared in each other's faces...
  But three make bitter company at one man's bread...
  And our hate grew sharp and bright as the moon's edge in the water.

  One grinned with his mouth awry from the long gapped teeth...
  And one shivered and whined like a gull as the waves pawed us over...
  But one struck with his hate in his hand...

  After that I remember
  Only the dead men's oars that flapped in the sea...
  The dead men's oars that rattled and clicked like idiots' tongues.

  It is still... so still, with the jargon of engines quiet.
  We three awaiting the crunch of the sea
  Reach our hands in the dark and touch each other's faces...
  We three sheathing hate in our hearts...
  But when hate shall have made its circuit,
  Our bones will be loving company
  Here in the sea's den...
  And one whimpers and cries on his God
  And one sits sullenly
  But both draw away from me...
  For I am the pyre their memories burn on...
  Like black flames leaping
  Our fiery gestures light the walled-in darkness of the sea...
  The sea that kneels above us...
  And makes no sign.

  PALESTINE

  Old plant of Asia--
  Mutilated vine
  Holding earth's leaping sap
  In every stem and shoot
  That lopped off, sprouts again--
  Why should you seek a plateau walled about,
  Whose garden is the world?

  THE SONG

  That day, in the slipping of torsos and straining flanks
       on the bloodied ooze of fields plowed by the iron,
  And the smoke bluish near earth and bronze in the sunshine
       floating like cotton-down,
  And the harsh and terrible screaming,
  And that strange vibration at the roots of us...
  Desire, fierce, like a song...
  And we heard
  (Do you remember?)
  All the Red Cross bands on Fifth avenue
  And bugles in little home towns
  And children's harmonicas bleating

       America!

  And after...
  (Do you remember?)
  The drollery of the wind on our faces,
  And horizons reeling,
  And the terror of the plain
  Heaving like a gaunt pelvis to the sun...
  Under us--threshing and twanging
  Torn-up roots of the Song...

  TO THE OTHERS

  I see you, refulgent ones,
  Burning so steadily
  Like big white arc lights...
  There are so many of you.
  I like to watch you weaving--
  Altogether and with precision
  Each his ray--
  Your tracery of light,
  Making a shining way about America.

  I note your infinite reactions--
  In glassware
  And sequin
  And puddles
  And bits of jet--
  And here and there a diamond...

  But you do not yet see me,
  Who am a torch blown along the wind,
  Flickering to a spark
  But never out.

  BABEL

  Oh, God did cunningly, there at Babel--
  Not mere tongues dividing, but soul from soul,
  So that never again should men be able
  To fashion one infinite, towering whole.

  THE FIDDLER

  In a little Hungarian cafe
  Men and women are drinking
  Yellow wine in tall goblets.

  Through the milky haze of the smoke,
  The fiddler, under-sized, blond,
  Leans to his violin
  As to the breast of a woman.
  Red hair kindles to fire
  On the black of his coat-sleeve,
  Where his white thin hand
  Trembles and dives,
  Like a sliver of moonlight,
  When wind has broken the water.

  DAWN WIND

  Wind, just arisen--
  (Off what cool mattress of marsh-moss
  In tented boughs leaf-drawn before the stars,
  Or niche of cliff under the eagles?)
  You of living things,
  So gay and tender and full of play--
  Why do you blow on my thoughts--like cut flowers
  Gathered and laid to dry on this paper, rolled out of dead wood?

  I see you
  Shaking that flower at me with soft invitation
  And frisking away,
  Deliciously rumpling the grass...

  So you fluttered the curtains about my cradle,
  Prattling of fields
  Before I had had my milk...
  Did I stir on my pillow, making to follow you, Fleet One?
  I--swaddled, unwinged, like a bird in the egg.

  Let be
  My dreams that crackle under your breath...
  You have the dust of the world to blow on...
  Do not tag me and dance away, looking back...
  I am too old to play with you,
  Eternal Child.

  NORTH WIND

  I love you, malcontent
  Male wind--
  Shaking the pollen from a flower
  Or hurling the sea backward from the grinning sand.

  Blow on and over my dreams...
  Scatter my sick dreams...
  Throw your lusty arms about me...
  Envelop all my hot body...
  Carry me to pine forests--
  Great, rough-bearded forests...
  Bring me to stark plains and steppes...
  I would have the North to-night--
  The cold, enduring North.

  And if we should meet the Snow,
  Whirling in spirals,
  And he should blind my eyes...
  Ally, you will defend me--
  You will hold me close,
  Blowing on my eyelids.

  THE DESTROYER

  I am of the wind...
  A wisp of the battering wind...

  I trail my fingers along the Alps
  And an avalanche falls in my wake...
  I feel in my quivering length
  When it buries the hamlet beneath...

  I hurriedly sweep aside
  The cities that clutter our path...
  As we whirl about the circle of the globe...
  As we tear at the pillars of the world...
  Open to the wind,
  The Destroyer!
  The wind that is battering at your gates.

  LULLABY

  Rock-a-by baby, woolly and brown...
  (There's a shout at the door an' a big red light...)
  Lil' coon baby, mammy is down...
  Han's that hold yuh are steady an' white...

  Look piccaninny--such a gran' blaze
  Lickin' up the roof an' the sticks of home--
  Ever see the like in all yo' days!
  --Cain't yuh sleep, mah bit-of-honey-comb?

  Rock-a-by baby, up to the sky!
  Look at the cherries driftin' by--
  Bright red cherries spilled on the groun'--
  Piping-hot cherries at nuthin' a poun'!

  Hush, mah lil' black-bug--doan yuh weep.
  Daddy's run away an' mammy's in a heap
  By her own fron' door in the blazin' heat
  Outah the shacks like warts on the street...

  An' the singin' flame an' the gleeful crowd
  Circlin' aroun'... won't mammy be proud!
  With a stone at her hade an' a stone on her heart,
  An' her mouth like a red plum, broken apart...

  See where the blue an' khaki prance,
  Adding brave colors to the dance
  About the big bonfire white folks make--
  Such gran' doin's fo' a lil' coon's sake!

  Hear all the eagah feet runnin' in town--
  See all the willin' han's reach outah night--
  Han's that are wonderful, steady an' white!
  To toss up a lil' babe, blinkin' an' brown...

  Rock-a-by baby--higher an' higher!
  Mammy is sleepin' an' daddy's run lame...
  (Soun' may yuh sleep in yo' cradle o' fire!)
  Rock-a-by baby, hushed in the flame...

(An incident of the East St. Louis Race Riots, when some white women
flung a living colored baby into the heart of a blazing fire.)

  THE FOUNDLING

  Snow wraiths circle us
  Like washers of the dead,
  Flapping their white wet cloths
  Impatiently
  About the grizzled head,
  Where the coarse hair mats like grass,
  And the efficient wind
  With cold professional baste
  Probes like a lancet
  Through the cotton shirt...

  About us are white cliffs and space.
  No façades show,
  Nor roof nor any spire...
  All sheathed in snow...
  The parasitic snow
  That clings about them like a blight.

  Only detached lights
  Float hazily like greenish moons,
  And endlessly
  Down the whore-street,
  Accouched and comforted and sleeping warm,
  The blizzard waltzes with the night.

  THE WOMAN WITH JEWELS

  The woman with jewels sits in the cafe,
  Spraying light like a fountain.
  Diamonds glitter on her bulbous fingers
  And on her arms, great as thighs,
  Diamonds gush from her ear-lobes over the goitrous throat.
  She is obesely beautiful.
  Her eyes are full of bleared lights,
  Like little pools of tar, spilled by a sailor in mad haste for shore...
  And her mouth is scarlet and full--only a little crumpled--
       like a flower that has been pressed apart...

  Why does she come alone to this obscure basement--
  She who should have a litter and hand-maidens to support her
       on either side?

  She ascends the stairway, and the waiters turn to look at her,
       spilling the soup.
  The black satin dress is a little lifted, showing the dropsical legs
       in their silken fleshings...
  The mountainous breasts tremble...
  There is an agitation in her gems,
  That quiver incessantly, emitting trillions of fiery rays...
  She erupts explosive breaths...
  Every step is an adventure
  From this...
  The serpent's tooth
  Saved Cleopatra.

  SUBMERGED

  I have known only my own shallows--
  Safe, plumbed places,
  Where I was wont to preen myself.

  But for the abyss
  I wanted a plank beneath
  And horizons...

  I was afraid of the silence
  And the slipping toe-hold...

  Oh, could I now dive
  Into the unexplored deeps of me--
  Delve and bring up and give
  All that is submerged, encased, unfolded,
  That is yet the best.

  ART AND LIFE

  When Art goes bounding, lean,
  Up hill-tops fired green
  To pluck a rose for life.

  Life like a broody hen
  Cluck-clucks him back again.

  But when Art, imbecile,
  Sits old and chill
  On sidings shaven clean,
  And counts his clustering
  Dead daisies on a string
  With witless laughter....

  Then like a new Jill
  Toiling up a hill
  Life scrambles after.

  BROOKLYN BRIDGE

  Pythoness body--arching
  Over the night like an ecstasy--
  I feel your coils tightening...
  And the world's lessening breath.

  DREAMS

  Men die...
  Dreams only change their houses.
  They cannot be lined up against a wall
  And quietly buried under ground,
  And no more heard of...
  However deep the pit and heaped the clay--
  Like seedlings of old time
  Hooding a sacred rose under the ice cap of the world--
  Dreams will to light.

  THE FIRE

  The old men of the world have made a fire
  To warm their trembling hands.
  They poke the young men in.
  The young men burn like withes.

  If one run a little way,
  The old men are wrath.
  They catch him and bind him and throw him again to the flames.
  Green withes burn slow...
  And the smoke of the young men's torment
  Rises round and sheer as the trunk of a pillared oak,
  And the darkness thereof spreads over the sky....

  Green withes burn slow...
  And the old men of the world sit round the fire
  And rub their hands....
  But the smoke of the young men's torment
  Ascends up for ever and ever.

  A MEMORY

  I remember
  The crackle of the palm trees
  Over the mooned white roofs of the town...
  The shining town...
  And the tender fumbling of the surf
  On the sulphur-yellow beaches
  As we sat... a little apart... in the close-pressing night.

  The moon hung above us like a golden mango,
  And the moist air clung to our faces,
  Warm and fragrant as the open mouth of a child
  And we watched the out-flung sea
  Rolling to the purple edge of the world,
  Yet ever back upon itself...
  As we...

  Inadequate night...
  And mooned white memory
  Of a tropic sea...
  How softly it comes up
  Like an ungathered lily.

  THE EDGE

  I thought to die that night in the solitude where they would never find me...
  But there was time...
  And I lay quietly on the drawn knees of the mountain,
       staring into the abyss...
  I do not know how long...
  I could not count the hours, they ran so fast
  Like little bare-foot urchins--shaking my hands away...
  But I remember
  Somewhere water trickled like a thin severed vein...
  And a wind came out of the grass,
  Touching me gently, tentatively, like a paw.

  As the night grew
  The gray cloud that had covered the sky like sackcloth
  Fell in ashen folds about the hills,
  Like hooded virgins, pulling their cloaks about them...
  There must have been a spent moon,
  For the Tall One's veil held a shimmer of silver...

  That too I remember...
  And the tenderly rocking mountain
  Silence
  And beating stars...

  Dawn
  Lay like a waxen hand upon the world,
  And folded hills
  Broke into a sudden wonder of peaks, stemming clear and cold,
  Till the Tall One bloomed like a lily,
  Flecked with sun,
  Fine as a golden pollen--
  It seemed a wind might blow it from the snow.

  I smelled the raw sweet essences of things,
  And heard spiders in the leaves
  And ticking of little feet,
  As tiny creatures came out of their doors
  To see God pouring light into his star...

  ... It seemed life held
  No future and no past but this...

  And I too got up stiffly from the earth,
  And held my heart up like a cup...

  THE GARDEN

  Bountiful Givers,
  I look along the years
  And see the flowers you threw...
  Anemones
  And sprigs of gray
  Sparse heather of the rocks,
  Or a wild violet
  Or daisy of a daisied field...
  But each your best.

  I might have worn them on my breast
  To wilt in the long day...
  I might have stemmed them in a narrow vase
  And watched each petal sallowing...
  I might have held them so--mechanically--
  Till the wind winnowed all the leaves
  And left upon my hands
  A little smear of dust.

  Instead
  I hid them in the soft warm loam
  Of a dim shadowed place...
  Deep
  In a still cool grotto,
  Lit only by the memories of stars
  And the wide and luminous eyes
  Of dead poets
  That love me and that I love...
  Deep... deep...
  Where none may see--not even ye who gave--
  About my soul your garden beautiful.

  UNDER-SONG

  There is music in the strong
       Deep-throated bush,
  Whisperings of song
       Heard in the leaves' hush--
  Ballads of the trees
       In tongues unknown--
  A reminiscent tone
       On minor keys...

  Boughs swaying to and fro
       Though no winds pass...
  Faint odors in the grass
       Where no flowers grow,
  And flutterings of wings
       And faint first notes,
  Once babbled on the boughs
       Of faded springs.

  Is it music from the graves
       Of all things fair
  Trembling on the staves
       Of spacious air--
  Fluted by the winds
       Songs with no words--
  Sonatas from the throats
       Of master birds?

  One peering through the husk
       Of darkness thrown
  May hear it in the dusk--
       That ancient tone,
  Silvery as the light
       Of long dead stars
  Yet falling through the night
       In trembling bars.

  A WORN ROSE

  Where to-day would a dainty buyer
  Imbibe your scented juice,
  Pale ruin with a heart of fire;
  Drain your succulence with her lips,
  Grown sapless from much use...
  Make minister of her desire
  A chalice cup where no bee sips--
       Where no wasp wanders in?

  Close to her white flesh housed an hour,
       One held you... her spent form
  Drew on yours for its wasted dower--
  What favour could she do you more?
       Yet, of all who drink therein,
       None know it is the warm
  Odorous heart of a ravished flower
  Tingles so in her mouth's red core...

  IRON WINE

  The ore in the crucible is pungent, smelling like acrid wine,
  It is dusky red, like the ebb of poppies,
  And purple, like the blood of elderberries.
  Surely it is a strong wine--juice distilled of the fierce iron.
  I am drunk of its fumes.
  I feel its fiery flux
  Diffusing, permeating,
  Working some strange alchemy...
  So that I turn aside from the goodly board,
  So that I look askance upon the common cup,
  And from the mouths of crucibles
  Suck forth the acrid sap.

  DISPOSSESSED

  Tender and tremulous green of leaves
  Turned up by the wind,
  Twanging among the vines--
  Wind in the grass
  Blowing a clear path
  For the new-stripped soul to pass...

  The naked soul in the sunlight...
  Like a wisp of smoke in the sunlight
  On the hill-side shimmering.

  Dance light on the wind, little soul,
  Like a thistle-down floating
  Over the butterflies
  And the lumbering bees...

  Come away from that tree
  And its shadow grey as a stone...

  Bathe in the pools of light
  On the hillside shimmering--
  Shining and wetted and warm in the sun-spray falling like golden rain--

  But do not linger and look
  At that bleak thing under the tree.

  THE STAR

  Last night
  I watched a star fall like a great pearl into the sea,
  Till my ego expanding encompassed sea and star,
  Containing both as in a trembling cup.

  THE TIDINGS
  (Easter 1916)

  Censored lies that mimic truth...
       Censored truth as pale as fear...
  My heart is like a rousing bell--
       And but the dead to hear...

  My heart is like a mother bird,
       Circling ever higher,
  And the nest-tree rimmed about
       By a forest fire...

  My heart is like a lover foiled
       By a broken stair--
  They are fighting to-night in Sackville Street,
       And I am not there!



    GOBLIN MARKET.


    Morning and evening
    Maids heard the goblins cry:
    "Come buy our orchard fruits,
    Come buy, come buy:
    Apples and quinces,
    Lemons and oranges,
    Plump unpecked cherries,
    Melons and raspberries,
    Bloom-down-cheeked peaches,
    Swart-headed mulberries,
    Wild free-born cranberries,
    Crab-apples, dewberries,
    Pine-apples, blackberries,
    Apricots, strawberries;--
    All ripe together
    In summer weather,--
    Morns that pass by,
    Fair eves that fly;
    Come buy, come buy:
    Our grapes fresh from the vine,
    Pomegranates full and fine,
    Dates and sharp bullaces,
    Rare pears and greengages,
    Damsons and bilberries,
    Taste them and try:
    Currants and gooseberries,
    Bright-fire-like barberries,
    Figs to fill your mouth,
    Citrons from the South,
    Sweet to tongue and sound to eye;
    Come buy, come buy."

      Evening by evening
    Among the brookside rushes,
    Laura bowed her head to hear,
    Lizzie veiled her blushes:
    Crouching close together
    In the cooling weather,
    With clasping arms and cautioning lips,
    With tingling cheeks and finger-tips.
    "Lie close," Laura said,
    Pricking up her golden head:
    "We must not look at goblin men,
    We must not buy their fruits:
    Who knows upon what soil they fed
    Their hungry thirsty roots?"
    "Come buy," call the goblins
    Hobbling down the glen.
    "O," cried Lizzie, "Laura, Laura,
    You should not peep at goblin men."
    Lizzie covered up her eyes,
    Covered close lest they should look;
    Laura reared her glossy head,
    And whispered like the restless brook:
    "Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,
    Down the glen tramp little men.
    One hauls a basket,
    One bears a plate,
    One lugs a golden dish
    Of many pounds' weight.
    How fair the vine must grow
    Whose grapes are so luscious;
    How warm the wind must blow
    Through those fruit bushes."
    "No," said Lizzie, "no, no, no;
    Their offers should not charm us,
    Their evil gifts would harm us."
    She thrust a dimpled finger
    In each ear, shut eyes and ran:
    Curious Laura chose to linger
    Wondering at each merchant man.
    One had a cat's face,
    One whisked a tail,
    One tramped at a rat's pace,
    One crawled like a snail,
    One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry,
    One like a ratel tumbled hurry-scurry.
    She heard a voice like voice of doves
    Cooing all together:
    They sounded kind and full of loves
    In the pleasant weather.

      Laura stretched her gleaming neck
    Like a rush-imbedded swan,
    Like a lily from the beck,
    Like a moonlit poplar branch,
    Like a vessel at the launch
    When its last restraint is gone.

      Backwards up the mossy glen
    Turned and trooped the goblin men,
    With their shrill repeated cry,
    "Come buy, come buy."
    When they reached where Laura was
    They stood stock still upon the moss,
    Leering at each other,
    Brother with queer brother;
    Signalling each other,
    Brother with sly brother.
    One set his basket down,
    One reared his plate;
    One began to weave a crown
    Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown
    (Men sell not such in any town);
    One heaved the golden weight
    Of dish and fruit to offer her:
    "Come buy, come buy," was still their cry.
    Laura stared but did not stir,
    Longed but had no money:
    The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste
    In tones as smooth as honey,
    The cat-faced purr'd,
    The rat-paced spoke a word
    Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;
    One parrot-voiced and jolly
    Cried "Pretty Goblin" still for "Pretty Polly";--
    One whistled like a bird.

      But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:
    "Good folk, I have no coin;
    To take were to purloin:
    I have no copper in my purse,
    I have no silver either,
    And all my gold is on the furze
    That shakes in windy weather
    Above the rusty heather."
    "You have much gold upon your head,"
    They answered altogether:
    "Buy from us with a golden curl."
    She clipped a precious golden lock,
    She dropped a tear more rare than pearl,
    Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red:
    Sweeter than honey from the rock,
    Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,
    Clearer than water flowed that juice;
    She never tasted such before,
    How should it cloy with length of use?
    She sucked and sucked and sucked the more
    Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;
    She sucked until her lips were sore;
    Then flung the emptied rinds away,
    But gathered up one kernel stone,
    And knew not was it night or day
    As she turned home alone.

      Lizzie met her at the gate
    Full of wise upbraidings:
    "Dear, you should not stay so late,
    Twilight is not good for maidens;
    Should not loiter in the glen
    In the haunts of goblin men.
    Do you not remember Jeanie,
    How she met them in the moonlight,
    Took their gifts both choice and many,
    Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
    Plucked from bowers
    Where summer ripens at all hours?
    But ever in the noonlight
    She pined and pined away;
    Sought them by night and day,
    Found them no more, but dwindled and grew gray,
    Then fell with the first snow,
    While to this day no grass will grow
    Where she lies low:
    I planted daisies there a year ago
    That never blow.
    You should not loiter so."
    "Nay, hush," said Laura:
    "Nay, hush, my sister:
    I ate and ate my fill,
    Yet my mouth waters still;
    To-morrow night I will
    Buy more,"--and kissed her.
    "Have done with sorrow;
    I'll bring you plums to-morrow
    Fresh on their mother twigs,
    Cherries worth getting;
    You cannot think what figs
    My teeth have met in,
    What melons icy-cold
    Piled on a dish of gold
    Too huge for me to hold,
    What peaches with a velvet nap,
    Pellucid grapes without one seed:
    Odorous indeed must be the mead
    Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink,
    With lilies at the brink,
    And sugar-sweet their sap."

      Golden head by golden head,
    Like two pigeons in one nest
    Folded in each other's wings,
    They lay down in their curtained bed:
    Like two blossoms on one stem,
    Like two flakes of new-fallen snow,
    Like two wands of ivory
    Tipped with gold for awful kings.
    Moon and stars gazed in at them,
    Wind sang to them lullaby,
    Lumbering owls forbore to fly,
    Not a bat flapped to and fro
    Round their rest:
    Cheek to cheek and breast to breast
    Locked together in one nest.

      Early in the morning
    When the first cock crowed his warning,
    Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,
    Laura rose with Lizzie:
    Fetched in honey, milked the cows,
    Aired and set to rights the house,
    Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,
    Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,
    Next churned butter, whipped up cream,
    Fed their poultry, sat and sewed;
    Talked as modest maidens should:
    Lizzie with an open heart,
    Laura in an absent dream,
    One content, one sick in part;
    One warbling for the mere bright day's delight,
    One longing for the night.

      At length slow evening came:
    They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;
    Lizzie most placid in her look,
    Laura most like a leaping flame.
    They drew the gurgling water from its deep;
    Lizzie plucked purple and rich golden flags,
    Then turning homeward said: "The sunset flushes
    Those furthest loftiest crags;
    Come, Laura, not another maiden lags,
    No wilful squirrel wags,
    The beasts and birds are fast asleep."
    But Laura loitered still among the rushes
    And said the bank was steep.

      And said the hour was early still,
    The dew not fallen, the wind not chill:
    Listening ever, but not catching
    The customary cry,
    "Come buy, come buy,"
    With its iterated jingle
    Of sugar-baited words:
    Not for all her watching
    Once discerning even one goblin
    Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;
    Let alone the herds
    That used to tramp along the glen,
    In groups or single,
    Of brisk fruit-merchant men.

      Till Lizzie urged: "O Laura, come;
    I hear the fruit-call, but I dare not look:
    You should not loiter longer at this brook:
    Come with me home.
    The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,
    Each glow-worm winks her spark,
    Let us get home before the night grows dark;
    For clouds may gather
    Though this is summer weather,
    Put out the lights and drench us through;
    Then if we lost our way what should we do?"

      Laura turned cold as stone
    To find her sister heard that cry alone,
    That goblin cry,
    "Come buy our fruits, come buy."
    Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?
    Must she no more such succous pasture find,
    Gone deaf and blind?
    Her tree of life drooped from the root:
    She said not one word in her heart's sore ache;
    But peering thro' the dimness, naught discerning,
    Trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way;
    So crept to bed, and lay
    Silent till Lizzie slept;
    Then sat up in a passionate yearning,
    And gnashed her teeth for balked desire, and wept
    As if her heart would break.

      Day after day, night after night,
    Laura kept watch in vain,
    In sullen silence of exceeding pain.
    She never caught again the goblin cry:
    "Come buy, come buy";--
    She never spied the goblin men
    Hawking their fruits along the glen:
    But when the noon waxed bright
    Her hair grew thin and gray;
    She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn
    To swift decay, and burn
    Her fire away.

      One day remembering her kernel-stone
    She set it by a wall that faced the south;
    Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root,
    Watched for a waxing shoot,
    But there came none;
    It never saw the sun,
    It never felt the trickling moisture run:
    While with sunk eyes and faded mouth
    She dreamed of melons, as a traveller sees
    False waves in desert drouth
    With shade of leaf-crowned trees,
    And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.

      She no more swept the house,
    Tended the fowls or cows,
    Fetched honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,
    Brought water from the brook:
    But sat down listless in the chimney-nook
    And would not eat.

      Tender Lizzie could not bear
    To watch her sister's cankerous care,
    Yet not to share.
    She night and morning
    Caught the goblins' cry:
    "Come buy our orchard fruits,
    Come buy, come buy."
    Beside the brook, along the glen,
    She heard the tramp of goblin men,
    The voice and stir
    Poor Laura could not hear;
    Longed to buy fruit to comfort her,
    But feared to pay too dear.
    She thought of Jeanie in her grave,
    Who should have been a bride;
    But who for joys brides hope to have
    Fell sick and died
    In her gay prime,
    In earliest winter-time,
    With the first glazing rime,
    With the first snow-fall of crisp winter-time.

      Till Laura, dwindling,
    Seemed knocking at Death's door:
    Then Lizzie weighed no more
    Better and worse,
    But put a silver penny in her purse,
    Kissed Laura, crossed the heath with clumps of furze
    At twilight, halted by the brook;
    And for the first time in her life
    Began to listen and look.

      Laughed every goblin
    When they spied her peeping:
    Came towards her hobbling,
    Flying, running, leaping,
    Puffing and blowing,
    Chuckling, clapping, crowing,
    Clucking and gobbling,
    Mopping and mowing,
    Full of airs and graces,
    Pulling wry faces,
    Demure grimaces,
    Cat-like and rat-like,
    Ratel and wombat-like,
    Snail-paced in a hurry,
    Parrot-voiced and whistler,
    Helter-skelter, hurry-skurry,
    Chattering like magpies,
    Fluttering like pigeons,
    Gliding like fishes,--
    Hugged her and kissed her;
    Squeezed and caressed her;
    Stretched up their dishes,
    Panniers and plates:
    "Look at our apples
    Russet and dun,
    Bob at our cherries,
    Bite at our peaches,
    Citrons and dates,
    Grapes for the asking,
    Pears red with basking
    Out in the sun,
    Plums on their twigs;
    Pluck them and suck them,
    Pomegranates, figs."

      "Good folk," said Lizzie,
    Mindful of Jeanie,
    "Give me much and many";--
    Held out her apron,
    Tossed them her penny.
    "Nay, take a seat with us,
    Honor and eat with us,"
    They answered grinning:
    "Our feast is but beginning.
    Night yet is early,
    Warm and dew-pearly,
    Wakeful and starry:
    Such fruits as these
    No man can carry;
    Half their bloom would fly,
    Half their dew would dry,
    Half their flavor would pass by.
    Sit down and feast with us,
    Be welcome guest with us,
    Cheer you and rest with us."
    "Thank you," said Lizzie; "but one waits
    At home alone for me:
    So, without further parleying,
    If you will not sell me any
    Of your fruits though much and many,
    Give me back my silver penny
    I tossed you for a fee."
    They began to scratch their pates,
    No longer wagging, purring,
    But visibly demurring,
    Grunting and snarling.
    One called her proud,
    Cross-grained, uncivil;
    Their tones waxed loud,
    Their looks were evil.
    Lashing their tails
    They trod and hustled her,
    Elbowed and jostled her,
    Clawed with their nails,
    Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,
    Tore her gown and soiled her stocking,
    Twitched her hair out by the roots,
    Stamped upon her tender feet,
    Held her hands and squeezed their fruits
    Against her mouth to make her eat.

      White and golden Lizzie stood,
    Like a lily in a flood,--
    Like a rock of blue-veined stone
    Lashed by tides obstreperously,--
    Like a beacon left alone
    In a hoary roaring sea,
    Sending up a golden fire,--
    Like a fruit-crowned orange-tree
    White with blossoms honey-sweet
    Sore beset by wasp and bee,--
    Like a royal virgin town
    Topped with gilded dome and spire
    Close beleaguered by a fleet
    Mad to tug her standard down.

      One may lead a horse to water,
    Twenty cannot make him drink.
    Though the goblins cuffed and caught her,
    Coaxed and fought her,
    Bullied and besought her,
    Scratched her, pinched her black as ink,
    Kicked and knocked her,
    Mauled and mocked her,
    Lizzie uttered not a word;
    Would not open lip from lip
    Lest they should cram a mouthful in;
    But laughed in heart to feel the drip
    Of juice that syrupped all her face,
    And lodged in dimples of her chin,
    And streaked her neck which quaked like curd.
    At last the evil people,
    Worn out by her resistance,
    Flung back her penny, kicked their fruit
    Along whichever road they took,
    Not leaving root or stone or shoot.
    Some writhed into the ground,
    Some dived into the brook
    With ring and ripple,
    Some scudded on the gale without a sound,
    Some vanished in the distance.

      In a smart, ache, tingle,
    Lizzie went her way;
    Knew not was it night or day;
    Sprang up the bank, tore through the furze,
    Threaded copse and dingle,
    And heard her penny jingle
    Bouncing in her purse,--
    Its bounce was music to her ear.
    She ran and ran
    As if she feared some goblin man
    Dogged her with gibe or curse
    Or something worse:
    But not one goblin skurried after,
    Nor was she pricked by fear;
    The kind heart made her windy-paced
    That urged her home quite out of breath with haste
    And inward laughter.

      She cried "Laura," up the garden,
    "Did you miss me?
    Come and kiss me.
    Never mind my bruises,
    Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices
    Squeezed from goblin fruits for you,
    Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
    Eat me, drink me, love me;
    Laura, make much of me:
    For your sake I have braved the glen
    And had to do with goblin merchant men."

      Laura started from her chair,
    Flung her arms up in the air,
    Clutched her hair:
    "Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted
    For my sake the fruit forbidden?
    Must your light like mine be hidden,
    Your young life like mine be wasted,
    Undone in mine undoing
    And ruined in my ruin,
    Thirsty, cankered, goblin-ridden?"
    She clung about her sister,
    Kissed and kissed and kissed her:
    Tears once again
    Refreshed her shrunken eyes,
    Dropping like rain
    After long sultry drouth;
    Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,
    She kissed and kissed her with a hungry mouth.

      Her lips began to scorch,
    That juice was wormwood to her tongue,
    She loathed the feast:
    Writhing as one possessed she leaped and sung,
    Rent all her robe, and wrung
    Her hands in lamentable haste,
    And beat her breast.
    Her locks streamed like the torch
    Borne by a racer at full speed,
    Or like the mane of horses in their flight,
    Or like an eagle when she stems the light
    Straight toward the sun,
    Or like a caged thing freed,
    Or like a flying flag when armies run.

      Swift fire spread through her veins, knocked at her heart,
    Met the fire smouldering there
    And overbore its lesser flame;
    She gorged on bitterness without a name:
    Ah! fool, to choose such part
    Of soul-consuming care!
    Sense failed in the mortal strife:
    Like the watch-tower of a town
    Which an earthquake shatters down,
    Like a lightning-stricken mast,
    Like a wind-uprooted tree
    Spun about,
    Like a foam-topped water-spout
    Cast down headlong in the sea,
    She fell at last;
    Pleasure past and anguish past,
    Is it death or is it life?

      Life out of death.
    That night long Lizzie watched by her,
    Counted her pulse's flagging stir,
    Felt for her breath,
    Held water to her lips, and cooled her face
    With tears and fanning leaves:
    But when the first birds chirped about their eaves,
    And early reapers plodded to the place
    Of golden sheaves,
    And dew-wet grass
    Bowed in the morning winds so brisk to pass,
    And new buds with new day
    Opened of cup-like lilies on the stream,
    Laura awoke as from a dream,
    Laughed in the innocent old way,
    Hugged Lizzie but not twice or thrice;
    Her gleaming locks showed not one thread of gray,
    Her breath was sweet as May,
    And light danced in her eyes.

      Days, weeks, months, years
    Afterwards, when both were wives
    With children of their own;
    Their mother-hearts beset with fears,
    Their lives bound up in tender lives;
    Laura would call the little ones
    And tell them of her early prime,
    Those pleasant days long gone
    Of not-returning time:
    Would talk about the haunted glen,
    The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,
    Their fruits like honey to the throat,
    But poison in the blood;
    (Men sell not such in any town;)
    Would tell them how her sister stood
    In deadly peril to do her good,
    And win the fiery antidote:
    Then joining hands to little hands
    Would bid them cling together,
    "For there is no friend like a sister,
    In calm or stormy weather,
    To cheer one on the tedious way,
    To fetch one if one goes astray,
    To lift one if one totters down,
    To strengthen whilst one stands."



    IN THE ROUND TOWER AT JHANSI,

    June 8, 1857.


    A hundred, a thousand to one; even so;
      Not a hope in the world remained:
    The swarming, howling wretches below
      Gained and gained and gained.

    Skene looked at his pale young wife:--
      "Is the time come?"--"The time is come!"--
    Young, strong, and so full of life:
      The agony struck them dumb.

    Close his arm about her now,
      Close her cheek to his,
    Close the pistol to her brow--
      God forgive them this!

    "Will it hurt much?"--"No, mine own:
      I wish I could bear the pang for both."
    "I wish I could bear the pang alone:
      Courage, dear, I am not loth."

    Kiss and kiss: "It is not pain
      Thus to kiss and die.
    One kiss more."--"And yet one again."--
      "Good by."--"Good by."


Note.--I retain this little poem, not as historically accurate, but as
written and published before I heard the supposed facts of its first
verse contradicted.



    DREAM-LAND.


    Where sunless rivers weep
    Their waves into the deep,
    She sleeps a charmèd sleep:
      Awake her not.
    Led by a single star,
    She came from very far
    To seek where shadows are
      Her pleasant lot.

    She left the rosy morn,
    She left the fields of corn,
    For twilight cold and lorn
      And water springs.
    Through sleep, as through a veil,
    She sees the sky look pale,
    And hears the nightingale
      That sadly sings.

    Rest, rest, a perfect rest
    Shed over brow and breast;
    Her face is toward the west,
      The purple land.
    She cannot see the grain
    Ripening on hill and plain;
    She cannot feel the rain
      Upon her hand.

    Rest, rest, forevermore
    Upon a mossy shore;
    Rest, rest at the heart's core
      Till time shall cease:
    Sleep that no pain shall wake,
    Night that no morn shall break,
    Till joy shall overtake
      Her perfect peace.



    AT HOME.


    When I was dead, my spirit turned
      To seek the much-frequented house
    I passed the door, and saw my friends
      Feasting beneath green orange-boughs;
    From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
      They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
    They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
      For each was loved of each.

    I listened to their honest chat:
      Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
    Plod plod along the featureless sands,
      And coasting miles and miles of sea."
    Said one: "Before the turn of tide
      We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
    Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
      To-day, but much more sweet."

    "To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
      And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
    "To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
      While no one spoke of yesterday.
    Their life stood full at blessed noon;
      I, only I, had passed away:
    "To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
      I was of yesterday.

    I shivered comfortless, but cast
      No chill across the table-cloth;
    I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
      To stay, and yet to part how loth:
    I passed from the familiar room,
      I who from love had passed away,
    Like the remembrance of a guest
      That tarrieth but a day.



    FROM SUNSET TO STAR RISE.


    Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not:
      I am no summer friend, but wintry cold,
      A silly sheep benighted from the fold,
    A sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot.
    Take counsel, sever from my lot your lot,
      Dwell in your pleasant places, hoard your gold;
      Lest you with me should shiver on the wold,
    Athirst and hungering on a barren spot.

    For I have hedged me with a thorny hedge,
      I live alone, I look to die alone:
    Yet sometimes when a wind sighs through the sedge,
      Ghosts of my buried years and friends come back,
    My heart goes sighing after swallows flown
      On sometime summer's unreturning track.



    LOVE FROM THE NORTH.


    I had a love in soft south land,
      Beloved through April far in May;
    He waited on my lightest breath,
      And never dared to say me nay.

    He saddened if my cheer was sad,
      But gay he grew if I was gay;
    We never differed on a hair,
      My yes his yes, my nay his nay.

    The wedding hour was come, the aisles
      Were flushed with sun and flowers that day;
    I pacing balanced in my thoughts,--
      "It's quite too late to think of nay."--

    My bridegroom answered in his turn,
      Myself had almost answered "yea":
    When through the flashing nave I heard.
      A struggle and resounding "nay."

    Bridemaids and bridegroom shrank in fear,
      But I stood high who stood at bay:
    "And if I answer yea, fair Sir,
      What man art thou to bar with nay?"

    He was a strong man from the north,
      Light-locked, with eyes of dangerous gray:
    "Put yea by for another time
      In which I will not say thee nay."

    He took me in his strong white arms,
      He bore me on his horse away
    O'er crag, morass, and hair-breadth pass,
      But never asked me yea or nay.

    He made me fast with book and bell,
      With links of love he makes me stay;
    Till now I've neither heart nor power
      Nor will nor wish to say him nay.



    WINTER RAIN.


    Every valley drinks,
      Every dell and hollow:
    Where the kind rain sinks and sinks,
      Green of Spring will follow.

    Yet a lapse of weeks
      Buds will burst their edges,
    Strip their wool-coats, glue-coats, streaks,
      In the woods and hedges;

    Weave a bower of love
      For birds to meet each other,
    Weave a canopy above
      Nest and egg and mother.

    But for fattening rain
      We should have no flowers,
    Never a bud or leaf again
      But for soaking showers;

    Never a mated bird
      In the rocking tree-tops,
    Never indeed a flock or herd
      To graze upon the lea-crops.

    Lambs so woolly white,
      Sheep the sun-bright leas on,
    They could have no grass to bite
      But for rain in season.

    We should find no moss
      In the shadiest places,
    Find no waving meadow-grass
      Pied with broad-eyed daisies;

    But miles of barren sand,
      With never a son or daughter,
    Not a lily on the land,
      Or lily on the water.



    A DIRGE.


    Why were you born when the snow was falling?
    You should have come to the cuckoo's calling,
    Or when grapes are green in the cluster,
    Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster
      For their far off flying
      From summer dying.

    Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?
    You should have died at the apples' dropping,
    When the grasshopper comes to trouble,
    And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,
      And all winds go sighing
      For sweet things dying.



    CONFLUENTS


    As rivers seek the sea,
      Much more deep than they,
    So my soul seeks thee
      Far away:
    As running rivers moan
    On their course alone
      So I moan
      Left alone.

    As the delicate rose
      To the sun's sweet strength
    Doth herself unclose,
      Breadth and length:
    So spreads my heart to thee
    Unveiled utterly,
      I to thee
      Utterly.

    As morning dew exhales
      Sunwards pure and free,
    So my spirit fails
      After thee:
    As dew leaves not a trace
    On the green earth's face;
      I, no trace
      On thy face.

    Its goal the river knows,
      Dewdrops find a way,
    Sunlight cheers the rose
      In her day:
    Shall I, lone sorrow past,
    Find thee at the last?
      Sorrow past,
      Thee at last?



    NOBLE SISTERS.


    "Now did you mark a falcon,
      Sister dear, sister dear,
    Flying toward my window
      In the morning cool and clear?
    With jingling bells about her neck,
      But what beneath her wing?
    It may have been a ribbon,
      Or it may have been a ring."--
          "I marked a falcon swooping
            At the break of day:
          And for your love, my sister dove,
            I 'frayed the thief away."--

    "Or did you spy a ruddy hound,
      Sister fair and tall,
    Went snuffing round my garden bound,
      Or crouched by my bower wall?
    With a silken leash about his neck;
      But in his mouth may be
    A chain of gold and silver links,
      Or a letter writ to me."--
          "I heard a hound, high-born sister,
            Stood baying at the moon:
          I rose and drove him from your wall
            Lest you should wake too soon."--

    "Or did you meet a pretty page
      Sat swinging on the gate;
    Sat whistling, whistling like a bird,
      Or may be slept too late:
    With eaglets broidered on his cap,
      And eaglets on his glove?
    If you had turned his pockets out,
      You had found some pledge of love."--
          "I met him at this daybreak,
            Scarce the east was red:
          Lest the creaking gate should anger you,
            I packed him home to bed."--

    "O patience, sister. Did you see
      A young man tall and strong,
    Swift-footed to uphold the right
      And to uproot the wrong,
    Come home across the desolate sea
      To woo me for his wife?
    And in his heart my heart is locked,
      And in his life my life."--
          "I met a nameless man, sister,
            Who loitered round our door:
          I said: Her husband loves her much.
            And yet she loves him more."--

    "Fie, sister, fie, a wicked lie,
      A lie, a wicked lie;
    I have none other love but him,
      Nor will have till I die.
    And you have turned him from our door,
      And stabbed him with a lie:
    I will go seek him thro' the world
      In sorrow till I die."--
          "Go seek in sorrow, sister,
            And find in sorrow too:
          If thus you shame our father's name
            My curse go forth with you."



    SPRING.


    Frost-locked all the winter,
    Seeds, and roots, and stones of fruits,
    What shall make their sap ascend
    That they may put forth shoots?
    Tips of tender green,
    Leaf, or blade, or sheath;
    Telling of the hidden life
    That breaks forth underneath,
    Life nursed in its grave by Death.

    Blows the thaw-wind pleasantly,
    Drips the soaking rain,
    By fits looks down the waking sun:
    Young grass springs on the plain;
    Young leaves clothe early hedgerow trees;
    Seeds, and roots, and stones of fruits,
    Swollen with sap, put forth their shoots;
    Curled-headed ferns sprout in the lane;
    Birds sing and pair again.

    There is no time like Spring,
    When life's alive in everything,
    Before new nestlings sing,
    Before cleft swallows speed their journey back
    Along the trackless track,--
    God guides their wing,
    He spreads their table that they nothing lack,--
    Before the daisy grows a common flower,
    Before the sun has power
    To scorch the world up in his noontide hour.

    There is no time like Spring,
    Like Spring that passes by;
    There is no life like Spring-life born to die,--
    Piercing the sod,
    Clothing the uncouth clod,
    Hatched in the nest,
    Fledged on the windy bough,
    Strong on the wing:
    There is no time like Spring that passes by,
    Now newly born, and now
    Hastening to die.



    THE LAMBS OF GRASMERE, 1860.


    The upland flocks grew starved and thinned:
      Their shepherds scarce could feed the lambs
    Whose milkless mothers butted them,
      Or who were orphaned of their dams.
    The lambs athirst for mother's milk
      Filled all the place with piteous sounds:
    Their mothers' bones made white for miles
      The pastureless wet pasture grounds.

    Day after day, night after night,
      From lamb to lamb the shepherds went,
    With teapots for the bleating mouths
      Instead of nature's nourishment.
    The little shivering gaping things
      Soon knew the step that brought them aid,
    And fondled the protecting hand,
      And rubbed it with a woolly head.

    Then, as the days waxed on to weeks,
      It was a pretty sight to see
    These lambs with frisky heads and tails
      Skipping and leaping on the lea,
    Bleating in tender, trustful tones,
      Resting on rocky crag or mound,
    And following the beloved feet
      That once had sought for them and found.

    These very shepherds of their flocks,
      These loving lambs so meek to please,
    Are worthy of recording words
      And honor in their due degrees:
    So I might live a hundred years,
      And roam from strand to foreign strand,
    Yet not forget this flooded spring
      And scarce-saved lambs of Westmoreland.



    A BIRTHDAY.


    My heart is like a singing bird
      Whose nest is in a watered shoot;
    My heart is like an apple-tree
      Whose boughs are bent with thick-set fruit;
    My heart is like a rainbow shell
      That paddles in a halcyon sea;
    My heart is gladder than all these
      Because my love is come to me.

    Raise me a dais of silk and down;
      Hang it with vair and purple dyes;
    Carve it in doves and pomegranates,
      And peacocks with a hundred eyes;
    Work it in gold and silver grapes,
      In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;
    Because the birthday of my life
      Is come, my love is come to me.



    REMEMBER.

    SONNET.


    Remember me when I am gone away,
      Gone far away into the silent land;
      When you can no more hold me by the hand,
    Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
    Remember me when no more, day by day,
      You tell me of our future that you planned:
      Only remember me; you understand
    It will be late to counsel then or pray.
    Yet if you should forget me for a while
      And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
      For if the darkness and corruption leave
      A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
    Better by far you should forget and smile
      Than that you should remember and be sad.



    AFTER DEATH.

    SONNET.


    The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept
      And strewn with rushes, rosemary and may
      Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay,
    Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept.
    He leaned above me, thinking that I slept
      And could not hear him; but I heard him say:
      "Poor child, poor child": and as he turned away
    Came a deep silence, and I knew he wept.
    He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold
      That hid my face, or take my hand in his,
        Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head:
        He did not love me living; but once dead
      He pitied me; and very sweet it is
    To know he still is warm though I am cold.



    AN END.


    Love, strong as Death, is dead.
    Come, let us make his bed
    Among the dying flowers:
    A green turf at his head;
    And a stone at his feet,
    Whereon we may sit
    In the quiet evening hours.

    He was born in the Spring,
    And died before the harvesting:
    On the last warm summer day
    He left us; he would not stay
    For autumn twilight, cold and gray.
    Sit we by his grave, and sing
    He is gone away.

    To few chords and sad and low
    Sing we so:
    Be our eyes fixed on the grass
    Shadow-veiled as the years pass,
    While we think of all that was
    In the long ago.



    MY DREAM.


    Hear now a curious dream I dreamed last night,
    Each word whereof is weighed and sifted truth.

      I stood beside Euphrates while it swelled
    Like overflowing Jordan in its youth:
    It waxed and colored sensibly to sight,
    Till out of myriad pregnant waves there welled
    Young crocodiles, a gaunt blunt-featured crew,
    Fresh-hatched perhaps and daubed with birthday dew.
    The rest if I should tell, I fear my friend,
    My closest friend, would deem the facts untrue;
    And therefore it were wisely left untold;
    Yet if you will, why, hear it to the end.

      Each crocodile was girt with massive gold
    And polished stones, that with their wearers grew:
    But one there was who waxed beyond the rest,
    Wore kinglier girdle and a kingly crown,
    Whilst crowns and orbs and sceptres starred his breast.
    All gleamed compact and green with scale on scale,
    But special burnishment adorned his mail,
    And special terror weighed upon his frown;
    His punier brethren quaked before his tail,
    Broad as a rafter, potent as a flail.
    So he grew lord and master of his kin:
    But who shall tell the tale of all their woes?
    An execrable appetite arose,
    He battened on them, crunched, and sucked them in.
    He knew no law, he feared no binding law,
    But ground them with inexorable jaw:
    The luscious fat distilled upon his chin,
    Exuded from his nostrils and his eyes,
    While still like hungry death he fed his maw;
    Till every minor crocodile being dead
    And buried too, himself gorged to the full,
    He slept with breath oppressed and unstrung claw.
    O marvel passing strange which next I saw:
    In sleep he dwindled to the common size,
    And all the empire faded from his coat.
    Then from far off a wingèd vessel came,
    Swift as a swallow, subtle as a flame:
    I know not what it bore of freight or host,
    But white it was as an avenging ghost.
    It levelled strong Euphrates in its course;
    Supreme yet weightless as an idle mote
    It seemed to tame the waters without force
    Till not a murmur swelled or billow beat:
    Lo, as the purple shadow swept the sands,
    The prudent crocodile rose on his feet
    And shed appropriate tears and wrung his hands.

      What can it mean? you ask. I answer not
    For meaning, but myself must echo, What?
    And tell it as I saw it on the spot.



    SONG.


    O roses for the flush of youth,
      And laurel for the perfect prime;
    But pluck an ivy branch for me
      Grown old before my time.

    O violets for the grave of youth,
      And bay for those dead in their prime;
    Give me the withered leaves I chose
      Before in the old time.



   THE HOUR AND THE GHOST.


                BRIDE.

    O love, love, hold me fast,--
    He draws me away from thee;
    I cannot stem the blast,
    Nor the cold strong sea:
    Far away a light shines
    Beyond the hills and pines;
    It is lit for me.

                BRIDEGROOM.

    I have thee close, my dear,
    No terror can come near;
    Only far off the northern light shines clear.

                GHOST.

    Come with me, fair and false,
    To our home, come home.
    It is my voice that calls:
    Once thou wast not afraid
    When I wooed, and said,
    "Come, our nest is newly made,"--
    Now cross the tossing foam.

                BRIDE.

    Hold me one moment longer,
    He taunts me with the past,
    His clutch is waxing stronger,
    Hold me fast, hold me fast.
    He draws me from thy heart,
    And I cannot withhold:
    He bids my spirit depart
    With him into the cold:--
    O bitter vows of old!

                BRIDEGROOM.

    Lean on me, hide thine eyes:
    Only ourselves, earth and skies,
    Are present here: be wise.

                GHOST.

    Lean on me, come away,
    I will guide and steady:
    Come, for I will not stay:
    Come, for house and bed are ready.
    Ah, sure bed and house,
    For better and worse, for life and death:
    Goal won with shortened breath:
    Come, crown our vows.

                BRIDE.

    One moment, one more word,
    While my heart beats still,
    While my breath is stirred
    By my fainting will.
    O friend forsake me not,
    Forget not as I forgot:
    But keep thy heart for me,
    Keep thy faith true and bright;
    Through the lone cold winter night
    Perhaps I may come to thee.

                BRIDEGROOM.

    Nay, peace, my darling, peace:
    Let these dreams and terrors cease:
    Who spoke of death or change or aught but ease?

                GHOST.

    O fair frail sin,
    O poor harvest gathered in!
    Thou shalt visit him again
    To watch his heart grow cold;
    To know the gnawing pain
    I knew of old;
    To see one much more fair
    Fill up the vacant chair,
    Fill his heart, his children bear:--
    While thou and I together
    In the outcast weather
    Toss and howl and spin.



    A SUMMER WISH.


    Live all thy sweet life through
      Sweet Rose, dew-sprent,
    Drop down thine evening dew
    To gather it anew
    When day is bright:
      I fancy thou wast meant
    Chiefly to give delight.

    Sing in the silent sky,
      Glad soaring bird;
    Sing out thy notes on high
    To sunbeam straying by
    Or passing cloud;
      Heedless if thou art heard
    Sing thy full song aloud.

    O that it were with me
      As with the flower;
    Blooming on its own tree
    For butterfly and bee
    Its summer morns:
      That I might bloom mine hour
    A rose in spite of thorns.

    O that my work were done
      As birds' that soar
    Rejoicing in the sun:
    That when my time is run
    And daylight too,
      I so might rest once more
    Cool with refreshing dew.



    AN APPLE GATHERING.


    I plucked pink blossoms from mine apple-tree,
      And wore them all that evening in my hair:
    Then in due season when I went to see
      I found no apples there.

    With dangling basket all along the grass
      As I had come I went the selfsame track:
    My neighbors mocked me while they saw me pass
      So empty-handed back.

    Lilian and Lilias smiled in trudging by,
      Their heaped-up basket teased me like a jeer;
    Sweet-voiced they sang beneath the sunset sky,
      Their mother's home was near.

    Plump Gertrude passed me with her basket full,
      A stronger hand than hers helped it along;
    A voice talked with her through the shadows cool
      More sweet to me than song.

    Ah, Willie, Willie, was my love less worth
      Than apples with their green leaves piled above?
    I counted rosiest apples on the earth
      Of far less worth than love.

    So once it was with me you stooped to talk
      Laughing and listening in this very lane:
    To think that by this way we used to walk
      We shall not walk again!

    I let my neighbors pass me, ones and twos
      And groups; the latest said the night grew chill,
    And hastened: but I loitered, while the dews
      Fell fast I loitered still.



    SONG.


    Two doves upon the selfsame branch,
      Two lilies on a single stem,
    Two butterflies upon one flower:--
      O happy they who look on them.

    Who look upon them hand in hand
      Flushed in the rosy summer light;
    Who look upon them hand in hand
      And never give a thought to night.



    MAUDE CLARE.


    Out of the church she followed them
      With a lofty step and mien:
    His bride was like a village maid,
      Maude Clare was like a queen.

    "Son Thomas," his lady mother said,
      With smiles, almost with tears:
    "May Nell and you but live as true
      As we have done for years;

    "Your father thirty years ago
      Had just your tale to tell;
    But he was not so pale as you,
      Nor I so pale as Nell."

    My lord was pale with inward strife,
      And Nell was pale with pride;
    My lord gazed long on pale Maude Clare
      Or ever he kissed the bride.

    "Lo, I have brought my gift, my lord,
      Have brought my gift," she said:
    "To bless the hearth, to bless the board,
      To bless the marriage-bed.

    "Here's my half of the golden chain
      You wore about your neck,
    That day we waded ankle-deep
      For lilies in the beck:

    "Here's my half of the faded leaves
      We plucked from budding bough,
    With feet amongst the lily-leaves,--
      The lilies are budding now."

    He strove to match her scorn with scorn,
      He faltered in his place:
    "Lady," he said,--"Maude Clare," he said,--
      "Maude Clare":--and hid his face.

    She turned to Nell: "My Lady Nell,
      I have a gift for you;
    Though, were it fruit, the bloom were gone,
      Or, were it flowers, the dew.

    "Take my share of a fickle heart,
      Mine of a paltry love:
    Take it or leave it as you will,
      I wash my hands thereof."

    "And what you leave," said Nell, "I'll take,
      And what you spurn, I'll wear;
    For he's my lord for better and worse,
      And him I love, Maude Clare.

    "Yea, though you're taller by the head,
      More wise, and much more fair;
    I'll love him till he loves me best,
      Me best of all, Maude Clare."



    ECHO.


    Come to me in the silence of the night;
      Come in the speaking silence of a dream;
    Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright
      As sunlight on a stream;
        Come back in tears,
    O memory, hope, love of finished years.

    O dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,
      Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,
    Where souls brimful of love abide and meet;
      Where thirsting longing eyes
        Watch the slow door
    That opening, letting in, lets out no more.

    Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live
      My very life again though cold in death:
    Come back to me in dreams, that I may give
      Pulse for pulse, breath for breath:
        Speak low, lean low,
    As long ago, my love, how long ago!



    WINTER: MY SECRET.


      I tell my secret? No indeed, not I:
    Perhaps some day, who knows?
    But not to-day; it froze, and blows, and snows,
    And you're too curious: fie!
    You want to hear it? well:
    Only, my secret's mine, and I won't tell.

      Or, after all, perhaps there's none:
    Suppose there is no secret after all,
    But only just my fun.
    To-day's a nipping day, a biting day;
    In which one wants a shawl,
    A veil, a cloak, and other wraps:
    I cannot ope to every one who taps,
    And let the draughts come whistling through my hall;
    Come bounding and surrounding me,
    Come buffeting, astounding me,
    Nipping and clipping through my wraps and all.
    I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows
    His nose to Russian snows
    To be pecked at by every wind that blows?
    You would not peck? I thank you for good-will,
    Believe, but leave that truth untested still.

      Spring's an expansive time: yet I don't trust
    March with its peck of dust,
    Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
    Nor even May, whose flowers
    One frost may wither through the sunless hours.

      Perhaps some languid summer day,
    When drowsy birds sing less and less,
    And golden fruit is ripening to excess,
    If there's not too much sun nor too much cloud,
    And the warm wind is neither still nor loud,
    Perhaps my secret I may say,
    Or you may guess.



    ANOTHER SPRING.


    If I might see another Spring
      I'd not plant summer flowers and wait:
    I'd have my crocuses at once,
    My leafless pink mezereons,
      My chill-veined snowdrops, choicer yet
      My white or azure violet,
    Leaf-nested primrose; anything
      To blow at once not late.

    If I might see another Spring
      I'd listen to the daylight birds
    That build their nests and pair and sing,
    Nor wait for mateless nightingale;
      I'd listen to the lusty herds,
      The ewes with lambs as white as snow,
    I'd find out music in the hail
      And all the winds that blow.

    If I might see another Spring--
      O stinging comment on my past
    That all my past results in "if"--
      If I might see another Spring
    I'd laugh to-day, to-day is brief;
      I would not wait for anything:
      I'd use to-day that cannot last,
      Be glad to-day and sing.



    A PEAL OF BELLS.


    Strike the bells wantonly,
      Tinkle tinkle well;
    Bring me wine, bring me flowers,
      Ring the silver bell.
    All my lamps burn scented oil,
      Hung on laden orange-trees,
    Whose shadowed foliage is the foil
      To golden lamps and oranges.
    Heap my golden plates with fruit,
      Golden fruit, fresh-plucked and ripe;
      Strike the bells and breathe the pipe;
    Shut out showers from summer hours;
    Silence that complaining lute;
      Shut out thinking, shut out pain,
      From hours that cannot come again.

    Strike the bells solemnly,
      Ding dong deep:
    My friend is passing to his bed,
      Fast asleep;
    There's plaited linen round his head,
      While foremost go his feet,--
    His feet that cannot carry him.
    My feast's a show, my lights are dim;
      Be still, your music is not sweet,--
    There is no music more for him:
      His lights are out, his feast is done;
    His bowl that sparkled to the brim
    Is drained, is broken, cannot hold;
    My blood is chill, his blood is cold;
      His death is full, and mine begun.



    FATA MORGANA.


    A blue-eyed phantom far before
      Is laughing, leaping toward the sun;
    Like lead I chase it evermore,
      I pant and run.

    It breaks the sunlight bound on bound;
      Goes singing as it leaps along
    To sheep-bells with a dreamy sound
      A dreamy song.

    I laugh, it is so brisk and gay;
      It is so far before, I weep:
    I hope I shall lie down some day,
      Lie down and sleep.



    "NO, THANK YOU, JOHN."


    I never said I loved you, John:
      Why will you tease me, day by day,
    And wax a weariness to think upon
      With always "do" and "pray"?

    You know I never loved you, John;
      No fault of mine made me your toast:
    Why will you haunt me with a face as wan
      As shows an hour-old ghost?

    I dare say Meg or Moll would take
      Pity upon you, if you'd ask:
    And pray don't remain single for my sake
      Who can't perform that task.

    I have no heart?--Perhaps I have not;
      But then you're mad to take offence
    That I don't give you what I have not got:
      Use your own common sense.

    Let bygones be bygones:
      Don't call me false, who owed not to be true:
    I'd rather answer "No" to fifty Johns
      Than answer "Yes" to you.

    Let's mar our pleasant days no more,
      Song-birds of passage, days of youth:
    Catch at to-day, forget the days before:
      I'll wink at your untruth.

    Let us strike hands as hearty friends;
      No more, no less: and friendship's good:
    Only don't keep in view ulterior ends,
      And points not understood

    In open treaty. Rise above
      Quibbles and shuffling off and on:
    Here's friendship for you if you like; but love,--
      No, thank you, John.



    MAY.


      I cannot tell you how it was;
    But this I know: it came to pass
    Upon a bright and breezy day
    When May was young; ah, pleasant May!
    As yet the poppies were not born
    Between the blades of tender corn;
    The last eggs had not hatched as yet,
    Nor any bird foregone its mate.

      I cannot tell you what it was;
    But this I know: it did but pass.
    It passed away with sunny May,
    With all sweet things it passed away,
    And left me old, and cold, and gray.



    A PAUSE OF THOUGHT.


    I looked for that which is not, nor can be,
      And hope deferred made my heart sick in truth
      But years must pass before a hope of youth
        Is resigned utterly.

    I watched and waited with a steadfast will:
      And though the object seemed to flee away
      That I so longed for, ever day by day
        I watched and waited still.

    Sometimes I said: This thing shall be no more;
      My expectation wearies and shall cease;
      I will resign it now and be at peace:
        Yet never gave it o'er.

    Sometimes I said: It is an empty name
      I long for; to a name why should I give
      The peace of all the days I have to live?--
        Yet gave it all the same.

    Alas, thou foolish one! alike unfit
      For healthy joy and salutary pain:
      Thou knowest the chase useless, and again
        Turnest to follow it.



    TWILIGHT CALM.


        O pleasant eventide!
        Clouds on the western side
    Grow gray and grayer, hiding the warm sun:
    The bees and birds, their happy labors done,
        Seek their close nests and bide.

        Screened in the leafy wood
        The stock-doves sit and brood:
    The very squirrel leaps from bough to bough
    But lazily; pauses; and settles now
        Where once he stored his food.

        One by one the flowers close,
        Lily and dewy rose
    Shutting their tender petals from the moon:
    The grasshoppers are still; but not so soon
        Are still the noisy crows.

        The dormouse squats and eats
        Choice little dainty bits
    Beneath the spreading roots of a broad lime;
    Nibbling his fill he stops from time to time
        And listens where he sits.

        From far the lowings come
        Of cattle driven home:
    From farther still the wind brings fitfully
    The vast continual murmur of the sea,
        Now loud, now almost dumb.

        The gnats whirl in the air,
        The evening gnats; and there
    The owl opes broad his eyes and wings to sail
    For prey; the bat wakes; and the shell-less snail
        Comes forth, clammy and bare.

        Hark! that's the nightingale,
        Telling the self-same tale
    Her song told when this ancient earth was young:
    So echoes answered when her song was sung
        In the first wooded vale.

        We call it love and pain
        The passion of her strain;
    And yet we little understand or know:
    Why should it not be rather joy that so
        Throbs in each throbbing vein?

        In separate herds the deer
        Lie; here the bucks, and here
    The does, and by its mother sleeps the fawn:
    Through all the hours of night until the dawn
        They sleep, forgetting fear.

        The hare sleeps where it lies,
        With wary half-closed eyes;
    The cock has ceased to crow, the hen to cluck:
    Only the fox is out, some heedless duck
        Or chicken to surprise.

        Remote, each single star
        Comes out, till there they are
    All shining brightly: how the dews fall damp!
    While close at hand the glow-worm lights her lamp
        Or twinkles from afar.

        But evening now is done
        As much as if the sun
    Day-giving had arisen in the east:
    For night has come; and the great calm has ceased,
        The quiet sands have run.



    WIFE TO HUSBAND.


    Pardon the faults in me,
      For the love of years ago:
        Good by.
    I must drift across the sea,
      I must sink into the snow,
        I must die.

    You can bask in this sun,
      You can drink wine, and eat:
        Good by.
    I must gird myself and run,
      Though with unready feet:
        I must die.

    Blank sea to sail upon,
      Cold bed to sleep in:
        Good by.
    While you clasp, I must be gone
      For all your weeping:
        I must die.

    A kiss for one friend,
      And a word for two,--
        Good by:--
    A lock that you must send,
      A kindness you must do:
        I must die.

    Not a word for you,
      Not a lock or kiss,
        Good by.
    We, one, must part in two:
      Verily death is this:
        I must die.



    THREE SEASONS.


      "A cup for hope!" she said,
    In springtime ere the bloom was old:
    The crimson wine was poor and cold
      By her mouth's richer red.

      "A cup for love!" how low,
    How soft the words; and all the while
    Her blush was rippling with a smile
      Like summer after snow.

      "A cup for memory!"
    Cold cup that one must drain alone:
    While autumn winds are up and moan
      Across the barren sea.

      Hope, memory, love:
    Hope for fair morn, and love for day,
    And memory for the evening gray
      And solitary dove.



    MIRAGE.


    The hope I dreamed of was a dream,
      Was but a dream; and now I wake
    Exceeding comfortless, and worn, and old,
      For a dream's sake.

    I hang my harp upon a tree,
      A weeping willow in a lake;
    I hang my silenced harp there, wrung and snapt
      For a dream's sake.

    Lie still, lie still, my breaking heart;
      My silent heart, lie still and break:
    Life, and the world, and mine own self, are changed
      For a dream's sake.



    SHUT OUT.


    The door was shut. I looked between
      Its iron bars; and saw it lie,
      My garden, mine, beneath the sky,
    Pied with all flowers bedewed and green:

    From bough to bough the song-birds crossed,
      From flower to flower the moths and bees;
      With all its nests and stately trees
    It had been mine, and it was lost.

    A shadowless spirit kept the gate,
      Blank and unchanging like the grave.
      I peering through said: "Let me have
    Some buds to cheer my outcast state."

    He answered not. "Or give me, then,
      But one small twig from shrub or tree;
      And bid my home remember me
    Until I come to it again."

    The spirit was silent; but he took
      Mortar and stone to build a wall;
      He left no loophole great or small
    Through which my straining eyes might look:

    So now I sit here quite alone
      Blinded with tears; nor grieve for that,
      For naught is left worth looking at
    Since my delightful land is gone.

    A violet bed is budding near,
      Wherein a lark has made her nest:
      And good they are, but not the best;
    And dear they are, but not so dear.



    SOUND SLEEP.


    Some are laughing, some are weeping;
    She is sleeping, only sleeping.
    Round her rest wild flowers are creeping;
    There the wind is heaping, heaping
    Sweetest sweets of Summer's keeping,
    By the cornfields ripe for reaping.

    There are lilies, and there blushes
    The deep rose, and there the thrushes
    Sing till latest sunlight flushes
    In the west; a fresh wind brushes
    Through the leaves while evening hushes.

    There by day the lark is singing
    And the grass and weeds are springing:
    There by night the bat is winging;
    There forever winds are bringing
    Far-off chimes of church-bells ringing.

    Night and morning, noon and even,
    Their sound fills her dreams with Heaven:
    The long strife at length is striven:
    Till her grave-bands shall be riven
    Such is the good portion given
    To her soul at rest and shriven.



    SONG.


    She sat and sang alway
      By the green margin of a stream,
    Watching the fishes leap and play
      Beneath the glad sunbeam.

    I sat and wept alway
      Beneath the moon's most shadowy beam,
    Watching the blossoms of the May
      Weep leaves into the stream.

    I wept for memory;
      She sang for hope that is so fair:
    My tears were swallowed by the sea;
      Her songs died on the air.



    SONG.


    When I am dead, my dearest,
      Sing no sad songs for me;
    Plant thou no roses at my head,
      Nor shady cypress-tree:
    Be the green grass above me
      With showers and dewdrops wet;
    And if thou wilt, remember,
      And if thou wilt, forget.

    I shall not see the shadows,
      I shall not feel the rain;
    I shall not hear the nightingale
      Sing on, as if in pain:
    And dreaming through the twilight
      That doth not rise nor set,
    Haply I may remember,
      And haply may forget.



    DEAD BEFORE DEATH.

    SONNET.


    Ah! changed and cold, how changed and very cold!
      With stiffened smiling lips and cold calm eyes:
      Changed, yet the same; much knowing, little wise;
    _This_ was the promise of the days of old!
    Grown hard and stubborn in the ancient mould,
      Grown rigid in the sham of lifelong lies:
      We hoped for better things as years would rise,
    But it is over as a tale once told.
    All fallen the blossom that no fruitage bore,
      All lost the present and the future time,
    All lost, all lost, the lapse that went before:
    So lost till death shut-to the opened door,
      So lost from chime to everlasting chime,
    So cold and lost forever evermore.



    BITTER FOR SWEET.


    Summer is gone with all its roses,
      Its sun and perfumes and sweet flowers,
      Its warm air and refreshing showers:
        And even Autumn closes.

    Yea, Autumn's chilly self is going,
      And winter comes which is yet colder;
      Each day the hoar-frost waxes bolder
        And the last buds cease blowing.



    "THE MASTER IS COME, AND CALLETH
    FOR THEE."


    Who calleth?--Thy Father calleth,
      Run, O Daughter, to wait on Him:
    He Who chasteneth but for a season
      Trims thy lamp that it burn not dim.

    Who calleth?--Thy Master calleth,
      Sit, Disciple, and learn of Him:
    He Who teacheth wisdom of Angels
      Makes thee wise as the Cherubim,

    Who calleth?--Thy Monarch calleth,
      Rise, O Subject, and follow Him:
    He is stronger than Death or Devil,
      Fear not thou if the foe be grim.

    Who calleth?--Thy Lord God calleth.
      Fall, O Creature, adoring Him:
    He is jealous, thy God Almighty,
      Count not dear to thee life or limb.

    Who calleth?--Thy Bridegroom calleth,
      Soar, O Bride, with the Seraphim:
    He Who loves thee as no man loveth,
      Bids thee give up thy heart to Him.



    REST.

    SONNET.


    O Earth, lie heavily upon her eyes;
      Seal her sweet eyes weary of watching, Earth;
      Lie close around her; leave no room for mirth
    With its harsh laughter, nor for sound of sighs.
    She hath no questions, she hath no replies,
      Hushed in and curtained with a blessed dearth
      Of all that irked her from the hour of birth;
    With stillness that is almost Paradise.
    Darkness more clear than noonday holdeth her,
      Silence more musical than any song;
    Even her very heart has ceased to stir:
    Until the morning of Eternity
    Her rest shall not begin nor end, but be;
      And when she wakes she will not think it long.



    THE FIRST SPRING DAY.


    I wonder if the sap is stirring yet,
    If wintry birds are dreaming of a mate,
    If frozen snowdrops feel as yet the sun
    And crocus fires are kindling one by one:
      Sing, robin, sing!
    I still am sore in doubt concerning Spring.

    I wonder if the spring-tide of this year
    Will bring another Spring both lost and dear;
    If heart and spirit will find out their Spring,
    Or if the world alone will bud and sing:
      Sing, hope, to me!
    Sweet notes, my hope, soft notes for memory.

    The sap will surely quicken soon or late,
    The tardiest bird will twitter to a mate;
    So Spring must dawn again with warmth and bloom,
    Or in this world, or in the world to come:
      Sing, voice of Spring!
    Till I too blossom and rejoice and sing.



    THE CONVENT THRESHOLD.


    There's blood between us, love, my love,
    There's father's blood, there's brother's blood;
    And blood's a bar I cannot pass:
    I choose the stairs that mount above,
    Stair after golden skyward stair,
    To city and to sea of glass.
    My lily feet are soiled with mud,
    With scarlet mud which tells a tale
    Of hope that was, of guilt that was,
    Of love that shall not yet avail;
    Alas, my heart, if I could bare
    My heart, this self-same stain is there:
    I seek the sea of glass and fire
    To wash the spot, to burn the snare;
    Lo, stairs are meant to lift us higher:
    Mount with me, mount the kindled stair.

      Your eyes look earthward, mine look up.
    I see the far-off city grand,
    Beyond the hills a watered land,
    Beyond the gulf a gleaming strand
    Of mansions where the righteous sup;
    Who sleep at ease among their trees,
    Or wake to sing a cadenced hymn
    With Cherubim and Seraphim;
    They bore the Cross, they drained the cup,
    Racked, roasted, crushed, wrenched limb from limb,
    They the offscouring of the world:
    The heaven of starry heavens unfurled,
    The sun before their face is dim.

    You looking earthward, what see you?
    Milk-white, wine-flushed among the vines,
    Up and down leaping, to and fro,
    Most glad, most full, made strong with wines,
    Blooming as peaches pearled with dew,
    Their golden windy hair afloat,
    Love-music warbling in their throat,
    Young men and women come and go.

      You linger, yet the time is short:
    Flee for your life, gird up your strength
    To flee: the shadows stretched at length
    Show that day wanes, that night draws nigh;
    Flee to the mountain, tarry not.
    Is this a time for smile and sigh,
    For songs among the secret trees
    Where sudden bluebirds nest and sport?
    The time is short and yet you stay:
    To-day, while it is called to-day,
    Kneel, wrestle, knock, do violence, pray;
    To-day is short, to-morrow nigh:
    Why will you die? why will you die?

      You sinned with me a pleasant sin:
    Repent with me, for I repent.
    Woe's me the lore I must unlearn!
    Woe's me that easy way we went,
    So rugged when I would return!
    How long until my sleep begin,
    How long shall stretch these nights and days?
    Surely, clean Angels cry, she prays;
    She laves her soul with tedious tears:
    How long must stretch these years and years?

      I turn from you my cheeks and eyes,
    My hair which you shall see no more,--
    Alas for joy that went before,
    For joy that dies, for love that dies.
    Only my lips still turn to you,
    My livid lips that cry, Repent!
    O weary life, O weary Lent,
    O weary time whose stars are few!

      How should I rest in Paradise,
    Or sit on steps of Heaven alone?
    If Saints and Angels spoke of love
    Should I not answer from my throne?
    Have pity upon me, ye my friends,
    For I have heard the sound thereof:
    Should I not turn with yearning eyes,
    Turn earthwards with a pitiful pang?
    O save me from a pang in Heaven!
    By all the gifts we took and gave,
    Repent, repent, and be forgiven:
    This life is long, but yet it ends;
    Repent and purge your soul and save:
    No gladder song the morning stars
    Upon their birthday morning sang
    Than Angels sing when one repents.

      I tell you what I dreamed last night:
    A spirit with transfigured face
    Fire-footed clomb an infinite space.
    I heard his hundred pinions clang,
    Heaven-bells rejoicing rang and rang,
    Heaven-air was thrilled with subtle scents,
    Worlds spun upon their rushing cars:
    He mounted shrieking: "Give me light!"
    Still light was poured on him, more light;
    Angels, Archangels he outstripped,
    Exultant in exceeding might,
    And trod the skirts of Cherubim.
    Still "Give me light," he shrieked; and dipped

    His thirsty face, and drank a sea,
    Athirst with thirst it could not slake.
    I saw him, drunk with knowledge, take
    From aching brows the aureole crown,--
    His locks writhed like a cloven snake,--
    He left his throne to grovel down
    And lick the dust of Seraphs' feet:
    For what is knowledge duly weighed?
    Knowledge is strong, but love is sweet;
    Yea, all the progress he had made
    Was but to learn that all is small
    Save love, for love is all in all.

      I tell you what I dreamed last night:
    It was not dark, it was not light,
    Cold dews had drenched my plenteous hair
    Through clay; you came to seek me there.
    And "Do you dream of me?" you said.
    My heart was dust that used to leap
    To you; I answered half asleep:
    "My pillow is damp, my sheets are red,
    There's a leaden tester to my bed:
    Find you a warmer playfellow,
    A warmer pillow for your head,
    A kinder love to love than mine."
    You wrung your hands; while I like lead
    Crushed downwards through the sodden earth:
    You smote your hands but not in mirth,
    And reeled but were not drunk with wine.

      For all night long I dreamed of you:
    I woke and prayed against my will,
    Then slept to dream of you again.
    At length I rose and knelt and prayed:
    I cannot write the words I said,
    My words were slow, my tears were few;
    But through the dark my silence spoke
    Like thunder. When this morning broke,
    My face was pinched, my hair was gray,
    And frozen blood was on the sill
    Where stifling in my struggle I lay.

      If now you saw me you would say:
    Where is the face I used to love?
    And I would answer: Gone before;
    It tarries veiled in Paradise.
    When once the morning star shall rise,
    When earth with shadow flees away
    And we stand safe within the door,
    Then you shall lift the veil thereof.
    Look up, rise up: for far above
    Our palms are grown, our place is set;
    There we shall meet as once we met,
    And love with old familiar love.



    UP-HILL.


    Does the road wind up-hill all the way?
      Yes, to the very end.
    Will the day's journey take the whole long day?
      From morn to night, my friend.

    But is there for the night a resting-place?
      A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.
    May not the darkness hide it from my face?
      You cannot miss that inn.

    Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?
      Those who have gone before.
    Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?
      They will not keep you standing at that door.

    Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?
      Of labor you shall find the sum.
    Will there be beds for me and all who seek?
      Yea, beds for all who come.




DEVOTIONAL PIECES.




    "THE LOVE OF CHRIST WHICH PASSETH KNOWLEDGE."


    I bore with thee long weary days and nights,
      Through many pangs of heart, through many tears;
    I bore with thee, thy hardness, coldness, slights,
      For three and thirty years.

    Who else had dared for thee what I have dared?
      I plunged the depth most deep from bliss above;
    I not My flesh, I not My spirit spared:
      Give thou Me love for love.

    For thee I thirsted in the daily drouth,
      For thee I trembled in the nightly frost:
    Much sweeter thou than honey to My mouth:
      Why wilt thou still be lost?

    I bore thee on My shoulders and rejoiced:
      Men only marked upon My shoulders borne
    The branding cross; and shouted hungry-voiced,
      Or wagged their heads in scorn.

    Thee did nails grave upon My hands, thy name
      Did thorns for frontlets stamp between Mine eyes:
    I, Holy One, put on thy guilt and shame;
      I, God, Priest, Sacrifice.

    A thief upon My right hand and My left;
      Six hours alone, athirst, in misery:
    At length in death one smote My heart and cleft
      A hiding-place for thee.

    Nailed to the racking cross, than bed of down
      More dear, whereon to stretch Myself and sleep:
    So did I win a kingdom,--share My crown;
      A harvest,--come and reap.



    "A BRUISED REED SHALL HE NOT BREAK."


    I will accept thy will to do and be,
      Thy hatred and intolerance of sin,
    Thy will at least to love, that burns within
      And thirsteth after Me:
    So will I render fruitful, blessing still
      The germs and small beginnings in thy heart,
      Because thy will cleaves to the better part.--
        Alas, I cannot will.

    Dost not thou will, poor soul? Yet I receive
      The inner unseen longings of the soul;
      I guide them turning towards Me; I control
        And charm hearts till they grieve:
    If thou desire, it yet shall come to pass,
      Though thou but wish indeed to choose My love;
      For I have power in earth and heaven above.--
        I cannot wish, alas!

    What, neither choose nor wish to choose? and yet
      I still must strive to win thee and constrain:
      For thee I hung upon the cross in pain,
        How then can I forget?
    If thou as yet dost neither love, nor hate,
      Nor choose, nor wish,--resign thyself, be still
      Till I infuse love, hatred, longing, will.--
        I do not deprecate.



    A BETTER RESURRECTION.


    I have no wit, no words, no tears;
      My heart within me like a stone
    Is numbed too much for hopes or fears;
      Look right, look left, I dwell alone;
    I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief
      No everlasting hills I see;
    My life is in the falling leaf:
        O Jesus, quicken me!

    My life is like a faded leaf,
      My harvest dwindled to a husk;
    Truly my life is void and brief
      And tedious in the barren dusk;
    My life is like a frozen thing,
      No bud nor greenness can I see:
    Yet rise it shall,--the sap of Spring;
        O Jesus, rise in me!

    My life is like a broken bowl,
      A broken bowl that cannot hold
    One drop of water for my soul
      Or cordial in the searching cold;
    Cast in the fire the perished thing,
      Melt and remould it, till it be
    A royal cup for Him my King:
        O Jesus, drink of me!



    ADVENT.


    This Advent moon shines cold and clear,
      These Advent nights are long;
    Our lamps have burned year after year,
      And still their flame is strong.
    "Watchman, what of the night?" we cry,
      Heart-sick with hope deferred:
    "No speaking signs are in the sky,"
      Is still the watchman's word.

    The Porter watches at the gate,
      The servants watch within;
    The watch is long betimes and late,
      The prize is slow to win.
    "Watchman, what of the night?" but still
      His answer sounds the same:
    "No daybreak tops the utmost hill,
      Nor pale our lamps of flame."

    One to another hear them speak,
      The patient virgins wise:
    "Surely He is not far to seek,"--
      "All night we watch and rise."
    "The days are evil looking back,
      The coming days are dim;
    Yet count we not His promise slack,
      But watch and wait for Him."

    One with another, soul with soul,
      They kindle fire from fire:
    "Friends watch us who have touched the goal."
      "They urge us, come up higher."
    "With them shall rest our waysore feet,
      With them is built our home,
    With Christ." "They sweet, but He most sweet,
      Sweeter than honeycomb."

    There no more parting, no more pain,
      The distant ones brought near,
    The lost so long are found again,
      Long lost but longer dear:
    Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard,
      Nor heart conceived that rest,
    With them our good things long deferred,
      With Jesus Christ our Best.

    We weep because the night is long,
      We laugh, for day shall rise,
    We sing a slow contented song
      And knock at Paradise.
    Weeping we hold Him fast Who wept
      For us,--we hold Him fast;
    And will not let Him go except
      He bless us first or last.

    Weeping we hold Him fast to-night;
      We will not let Him go
    Till daybreak smite our wearied sight,
      And summer smite the snow:
    Then figs shall bud, and dove with dove
      Shall coo the livelong day;
    Then He shall say, "Arise, My love,
      My fair one, come away."



    THE THREE ENEMIES.


            THE FLESH.

    "Sweet, thou art pale."
                "More pale to see,
    Christ hung upon the cruel tree
    And bore His Father's wrath for me."

    "Sweet, thou art sad."
                "Beneath a rod
    More heavy, Christ for my sake trod
    The winepress of the wrath of God."

    "Sweet, thou art weary."
                "Not so Christ:
    Whose mighty love of me sufficed
    For Strength, Salvation, Eucharist."

    "Sweet, thou art footsore."
                "If I bleed,
    His feet have bled: yea, in my need
    His Heart once bled for mine indeed."


            THE WORLD.

    "Sweet, thou art young."
                "So He was young
    Who for my sake in silence hung
    Upon the Cross with Passion wrung."

    "Look, thou art fair."
                "He was more fair
    Than men, Who deigned for me to wear
    A visage marred beyond compare."

    "And thou hast riches."
                "Daily bread:
    All else is His; Who living, dead,
    For me lacked where to lay His Head."

    "And life is sweet."
                "It was not so
    To Him, Whose Cup did overflow
    With mine unutterable woe."


            THE DEVIL.

    "Thou drinkest deep."
                "When Christ would sup
    He drained the dregs from out my cup:
    So how should I be lifted up?"

    "Thou shalt win Glory."
                "In the skies,
    Lord Jesus, cover up mine eyes
    Lest they should look on vanities."

    "Thou shalt have Knowledge."
                "Helpless dust,
    In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust:
    Answer Thou for me, Wise and Just."

    "And Might."
                "Get thee behind me. Lord,
    Who hast redeemed and not abhorred
    My soul, O keep it by Thy Word."



    ONE CERTAINTY.

    SONNET.


    Vanity of vanities, the Preacher saith,
      All things are vanity. The eye and ear
      Cannot be filled with what they see and hear.
    Like early dew, or like the sudden breath
    Of wind, or like the grass that withereth,
      Is man, tossed to and fro by hope and fear:
      So little joy hath he, so little cheer,
    Till all things end in the long dust of death.
    To-day is still the same as yesterday,
      To-morrow also even as one of them;
    And there is nothing new under the sun:
    Until the ancient race of Time be run,
      The old thorns shall grow out of the old stem,
    And morning shall be cold, and twilight gray.



    CHRISTIAN AND JEW.

    A DIALOGUE.


    "O happy happy land!
    Angels like rushes stand
      About the wells of light."--
      "Alas, I have not eyes for this fair sight:
    Hold fast my hand."--

    "As in a soft wind, they
    Bend all one blessed way,
      Each bowed in his own glory, star with star."--
      "I cannot see so far,
      Here shadows are."--

    "White-winged the cherubim,
    Yet whiter seraphim,
      Glow white with intense fire of love."--
    "Mine eyes are dim:
      I look in vain above,
    And miss their hymn."--

    "Angels, Archangels cry
    One to other ceaselessly
      (I hear them sing)
      One 'Holy, Holy, Holy,' to their King."--
    "I do not hear them, I."--

    "Joy to thee, Paradise,--
      Garden and goal and nest!
    Made green for wearied eyes;
      Much softer than the breast
    Of mother-dove clad in a rainbow's dyes.

    "All precious souls are there
      Most safe, elect by grace,
      All tears are wiped forever from their face:
    Untired in prayer
      They wait and praise,
      Hidden for a little space.

    "Boughs of the Living Vine,
    They spread in summer shine
      Green leaf with leaf:
    Sap of the Royal Vine, it stirs like wine
      In all both less and chief.

    "Sing to the Lord,
      All spirits of all flesh, sing;
    For He hath not abhorred
      Our low estate nor scorned our offering:
      Shout to our King."--

    "But Zion said:
      My Lord forgetteth me.
    Lo, she hath made her bed
      In dust; forsaken weepeth she
      Where alien rivers swell the sea.

    "She laid her body as the ground,
      Her tender body as the ground to those
    Who passed; her harpstrings cannot sound
    In a strange land; discrowned
      She sits, and drunk with woes."--

    "O drunken not with wine,
      Whose sins and sorrows have fulfilled the sum,--
      Be not afraid, arise, be no more dumb;
    Arise, shine,
      For thy light is come."--

    "Can these bones live?"--
                "God knows:
      The prophet saw such clothed with flesh and skin
      A wind blew on them and life entered in;
    They shook and rose.
      Hasten the time, O Lord, blot out their sin,
      Let life begin."



    SWEET DEATH.


    The sweetest blossoms die.
      And so it was that, going day by day
      Unto the church to praise and pray,
    And crossing the green churchyard thoughtfully,
      I saw how on the graves the flowers
      Shed their fresh leaves in showers,
    And how their perfume rose up to the sky
      Before it passed away.

    The youngest blossoms die.
      They die and fall and nourish the rich earth
      From which they lately had their birth;
    Sweet life, but sweeter death that passeth by
      And is as though it had not been:--
      All colors turn to green;
    The bright hues vanish and the odors fly,
      The grass hath lasting worth.

    And youth and beauty die.
      So be it, O my God, Thou God of truth:
      Better than beauty and than youth
    Are Saints and Angels, a glad company;
      And Thou, O Lord, our Rest and Ease,
      Art better far than these.
    Why should we shrink from our full harvest? why
      Prefer to glean with Ruth?



    SYMBOLS.


    I watched a rosebud very long
      Brought on by dew and sun and shower,
      Waiting to see the perfect flower:
    Then, when I thought it should be strong,
      It opened at the matin hour
    And fell at even-song.

    I watched a nest from day to day,
      A green nest full of pleasant shade,
      Wherein three speckled eggs were laid:
    But when they should have hatched in May,
      The two old birds had grown afraid
    Or tired, and flew away.

    Then in my wrath I broke the bough
      That I had tended so with care,
      Hoping its scent should fill the air;
    I crushed the eggs, not heeding how
      Their ancient promise had been fair:
    I would have vengeance now.

    But the dead branch spoke from the sod,
      And the eggs answered me again:
      Because we failed dost thou complain?
    Is thy wrath just? And what if God,
      Who waiteth for thy fruits in vain,
    Should also take the rod?



    "CONSIDER THE LILIES OF THE FIELD."


    Flowers preach to us if we will hear:--
    The rose saith in the dewy morn,
    I am most fair;
    Yet all my loveliness is born
    Upon a thorn.
    The poppy saith amid the corn:
    Let but my scarlet head appear
    And I am held in scorn;
    Yet juice of subtle virtue lies
    Within my cup of curious dyes.
    The lilies say: Behold how we
    Preach without words of purity.
    The violets whisper from the shade
    Which their own leaves have made:
    Men scent our fragrance on the air,
    Yet take no heed
    Of humble lessons we would read.

    But not alone the fairest flowers:
    The merest grass
    Along the roadside where we pass,
    Lichen and moss and sturdy weed,
    Tell of His love who sends the dew,
    The rain and sunshine too,
    To nourish one small seed.



    THE WORLD.

    SONNET.


    By day she wooes me, soft, exceeding fair:
      But all night as the moon so changeth she;
      Loathsome and foul with hideous leprosy,
    And subtle serpents gliding in her hair.
    By day she wooes me to the outer air,
      Ripe fruits, sweet flowers, and full satiety:
      But through the night, a beast she grins at me,
    A very monster void of love and prayer.
    By day she stands a lie: by night she stands,
      In all the naked horror of the truth,
    With pushing horns and clawed and clutching hands.
    Is this a friend indeed; that I should sell
      My soul to her, give her my life and youth,
    Till my feet, cloven too, take hold on hell?



    A TESTIMONY.


    I said of laughter, it is vain.
      Of mirth I said, what profits it?
      Therefore I found a book, and writ
    Therein how ease and also pain,
    How health and sickness, every one
    Is vanity beneath the sun.

    Man walks in a vain shadow; he
      Disquieteth himself in vain.
      The things that were shall be again.
    The rivers do not fill the sea,
    But turn back to their secret source;
    The winds too turn upon their course.

    Our treasures moth and rust corrupt,
      Or thieves break through and steal, or they
      Make themselves wings and fly away.
    One man made merry as he supped,
    Nor guessed how when that night grew dim
    His soul would be required of him.

    We build our houses on the sand,
      Comely withoutside and within;
      But when the winds and rains begin
    To beat on them, they cannot stand;
    They perish, quickly overthrown,
    Loose from the very basement stone.

    All things are vanity, I said,--
      Yea, vanity of vanities.
      The rich man dies; and the poor dies;
    The worm feeds sweetly on the dead.
    Whate'er thou lackest, keep this trust:
    All in the end shall have but dust:

    The one inheritance, which best
      And worst alike shall find and share:
      The wicked cease from troubling there,
    And there the weary be at rest;
    There all the wisdom of the wise
    Is vanity of vanities.

    Man flourishes as a green leaf,
      And as a leaf doth pass away;
      Or, as a shade that cannot stay
    And leaves no track, his course is brief:
    Yet man doth hope and fear and plan
    Till he is dead:--O foolish man!

    Our eyes cannot be satisfied
      With seeing, nor our ears be filled
      With hearing: yet we plant and build
    And buy and make our borders wide;
    We gather wealth, we gather care,
    But know not who shall be our heir.

    Why should we hasten to arise
      So early, and so late take rest?
      Our labor is not good; our best
    Hopes fade; our heart is stayed on lies:
    Verily, we sow wind; and we
    Shall reap the whirlwind, verily.

    He who hath little shall not lack;
      He who hath plenty shall decay:
      Our fathers went; we pass away;
    Our children follow on our track:
    So generations fail, and so
    They are renewed and come and go.

    The earth is fattened with our dead;
      She swallows more and doth not cease:
      Therefore her wine and oil increase
    And her sheaves are not numberèd;
    Therefore her plants are green, and all
    Her pleasant trees lusty and tall.

    Therefore the maidens cease to sing,
      And the young men are very sad;
      Therefore the sowing is not glad,
    And mournful is the harvesting.
    Of high and low, of great and small,
    Vanity is the lot of all.

    A King dwelt in Jerusalem;
      He was the wisest man on earth;
      He had all riches from his birth,
    And pleasures till he tired of them;
    Then, having tested all things, he
    Witnessed that all are vanity.



    SLEEP AT SEA.


    Sound the deep waters:--
      Who shall sound that deep?--
    Too short the plummet,
      And the watchmen sleep.
    Some dream of effort
      Up a toilsome steep;
    Some dream of pasture grounds
      For harmless sheep.

    White shapes flit to and fro
      From mast to mast;
    They feel the distant tempest
      That nears them fast:
    Great rocks are straight ahead,
      Great shoals not past;
    They shout to one another
      Upon the blast.

    O, soft the streams drop music
      Between the hills,
    And musical the birds' nests
      Beside those rills:
    The nests are types of home
       Love-hidden from ills,
    The nests are types of spirits
      Love-music fills.

    So dream the sleepers,
      Each man in his place;
    The lightning shows the smile
      Upon each face:
    The ship is driving, driving,
      It drives apace:
    And sleepers smile, and spirits
      Bewail their case.

    The lightning glares and reddens
      Across the skies;
    It seems but sunset
      To those sleeping eyes.
    When did the sun go down
      On such a wise?
    From such a sunset
      When shall day arise?

    "Wake," call the spirits:
      But to heedless ears;
    They have forgotten sorrows
      And hopes and fears;
    They have forgotten perils
      And smiles and tears;
    Their dream has held them long,
      Long years and years.

    "Wake," call the spirits again:
      But it would take
    A louder summons
      To bid them awake.
    Some dream of pleasure
      For another's sake;
    Some dream, forgetful
      Of a lifelong ache.

    One by one slowly,
      Ah, how sad and slow!
    Wailing and praying
      The spirits rise and go:
    Clear stainless spirits,
      White,--as white as snow;
    Pale spirits, wailing
      For an overthrow.

    One by one flitting,
      Like a mournful bird
    Whose song is tired at last
      For no mate heard.
    The loving voice is silent,
      The useless word;
    One by one flitting,
      Sick with hope deferred.

    Driving and driving,
      The ship drives amain:
    While swift from mast to mast
      Shapes flit again,
    Flit silent as the silence
      Where men lie slain;
    Their shadow cast upon the sails
      Is like a stain.

    No voice to call the sleepers,
      No hand to raise:
    They sleep to death in dreaming
      Of length of days.
    Vanity of vanities,
      The Preacher says:
    Vanity is the end
      Of all their ways.



    FROM HOUSE TO HOME.


    The first was like a dream through summer heat,
      The second like a tedious numbing swoon,
    While the half-frozen pulses lagged to beat
      Beneath a winter moon.

    "But," says my friend, "what was this thing and where?"
      It was a pleasure-place within my soul;
    An earthly paradise supremely fair
      That lured me from the goal.

    The first part was a tissue of hugged lies;
      The second was its ruin fraught with pain:
    Why raise the fair delusion to the skies
      But to be dashed again?

    My castle stood of white transparent glass
      Glittering and frail with many a fretted spire,
    But when the summer sunset came to pass
      It kindled into fire.

    My pleasaunce was an undulating green,
      Stately with trees whose shadows slept below,
    With glimpses of smooth garden-beds between,
      Like flame or sky or snow.

    Swift squirrels on the pastures took their ease,
      With leaping lambs safe from the unfeared knife;
    All singing-birds rejoicing in those trees
      Fulfilled their careless life.

    Wood-pigeons cooed there, stock-doves nestled there;
      My trees were full of songs and flowers and fruit,
    Their branches spread a city to the air,
      And mice lodged in their root.

    My heath lay farther off, where lizards lived
      In strange metallic mail, just spied and gone;
    Like darted lightnings here and there perceived
      But nowhere dwelt upon.

    Frogs and fat toads were there to hop or plod
      And propagate in peace, an uncouth crew,
    Where velvet-headed rushes rustling nod
      And spill the morning dew.

    All caterpillars throve beneath my rule,
      With snails and slugs in corners out of sight;
    I never marred the curious sudden stool
      That perfects in a night.

    Safe in his excavated gallery
      The burrowing mole groped on from year to year;
    No harmless hedgehog curled because of me
      His prickly back for fear.

    Ofttimes one like an angel walked with me,
      With spirit-discerning eyes like flames of fire,
    But deep as the unfathomed endless sea
      Fulfilling my desire:

    And sometimes like a snowdrift he was fair,
      And sometimes like a sunset glorious red,
    And sometimes he had wings to scale the air
      With aureole round his head.

    We sang our songs together by the way,
      Calls and recalls and echoes of delight;
    So communed we together all the day,
      And so in dreams by night.

    I have no words to tell what way we walked,
      What unforgotten path now closed and sealed;
    I have no words to tell all things we talked,
      All things that he revealed:

    This only can I tell: that hour by hour
      I waxed more feastful, lifted up and glad;
    I felt no thorn-prick when I plucked a flower,
      Felt not my friend was sad.

    "To-morrow," once I said to him with smiles:
      "To-night," he answered gravely and was dumb,
    But pointed out the stones that numbered miles
      And miles and miles to come.

    "Not so," I said: "to-morrow shall be sweet;
      To-night is not so sweet as coming days."
    Then first I saw that he had turned his feet,
      Had turned from me his face:

    Running and flying miles and miles he went,
      But once looked back to beckon with his hand
    And cry: "Come home, O love, from banishment:
      Come to the distant land."

    That night destroyed me like an avalanche;
      One night turned all my summer back to snow:
    Next morning not a bird upon my branch,
      Not a lamb woke below,--

    No bird, no lamb, no living breathing thing;
      No squirrel scampered on my breezy lawn,
    No mouse lodged by his hoard: all joys took wing
      And fled before that dawn.

    Azure and sun were starved from heaven above,
      No dew had fallen, but biting frost lay hoar:
    O love, I knew that I should meet my love,
      Should find my love no more.

    "My love no more," I muttered, stunned with pain:
      I shed no tear, I wrung no passionate hand,
    Till something whispered: "You shall meet again,
      Meet in a distant land."

    Then with a cry like famine I arose,
      I lit my candle, searched from room to room,
    Searched up and down; a war of winds that froze
      Swept through the blank of gloom.

    I searched day after day, night after night;
      Scant change there came to me of night or day:
    "No more," I wailed, "no more"; and trimmed my light,
      And gnashed, but did not pray,

    Until my heart broke and my spirit broke:
      Upon the frost-bound floor I stumbled, fell,
    And moaned: "It is enough: withhold the stroke.
      Farewell, O love, farewell."

    Then life swooned from me. And I heard the song
      Of spheres and spirits rejoicing over me:
    One cried: "Our sister, she hath suffered long."--
      One answered: "Make her see."--

    One cried: "O blessed she who no more pain,
      Who no more disappointment shall receive."--
    One answered: "Not so: she must live again;
      Strengthen thou her to live."

    So, while I lay entranced, a curtain seemed
      To shrivel with crackling from before my face,
    Across mine eyes a waxing radiance beamed
      And showed a certain place.

    I saw a vision of a woman, where
      Night and new morning strive for domination;
    Incomparably pale, and almost fair,
      And sad beyond expression.

    Her eyes were like some fire-enshrining gem,
      Were stately like the stars, and yet were tender,
    Her figure charmed me like a windy stem
      Quivering and drooped and slender.

    I stood upon the outer barren ground,
      She stood on inner ground that budded flowers;
    While circling in their never-slackening round
      Danced by the mystic hours.

    But every flower was lifted on a thorn,
      And every thorn shot upright from its sands
    To gall her feet; hoarse laughter pealed in scorn
      With cruel clapping hands.

    She bled and wept, yet did not shrink; her strength
      Was strung up until daybreak of delight:
    She measured measureless sorrow toward its length,
      And breadth, and depth, and height.

    Then marked I how a chain sustained her form,
      A chain of living links not made nor riven:
    It stretched sheer up through lightning, wind, and storm,
      And anchored fast in heaven.

    One cried: "How long? yet founded on the Rock
      She shall do battle, suffer, and attain."--
    One answered: "Faith quakes in the tempest shock:
      Strengthen her soul again."

    I saw a cup sent down and come to her
      Brimful of loathing and of bitterness:
    She drank with livid lips that seemed to stir
      The depth, not make it less.

    But as she drank I spied a hand distil
      New wine and virgin honey; making it
    First bitter-sweet, then sweet indeed, until
      She tasted only sweet.

    Her lips and cheeks waxed rosy-fresh and young;
      Drinking she sang: "My soul shall nothing want";
    And drank anew: while soft a song was sung,
      A mystical slow chant.

    One cried: "The wounds are faithful of a friend:
      The wilderness shall blossom as a rose."--
    One answered: "Rend the veil, declare the end,
      Strengthen her ere she goes."

    Then earth and heaven were rolled up like a scroll;
      Time and space, change and death, had passed away;
    Weight, number, measure, each had reached its whole:
      The day had come, that day.

    Multitudes--multitudes--stood up in bliss,
      Made equal to the angels, glorious, fair;
    With harps, palms, wedding-garments, kiss of peace,
      And crowned and haloed hair.

    They sang a song, a new song in the height,
      Harping with harps to Him Who is Strong and True:
    They drank new wine, their eyes saw with new light,
      Lo, all things were made new.

    Tier beyond tier they rose and rose and rose
      So high that it was dreadful, flames with flames:
    No man could number them, no tongue disclose
      Their secret sacred names.

    As though one pulse stirred all, one rush of blood
      Fed all, one breath swept through them myriad voiced,
    They struck their harps, cast down their crowns, they stood
      And worshipped and rejoiced.

    Each face looked one way like a moon new-lit,
      Each face looked one way towards its Sun of Love;
    Drank love and bathed in love and mirrored it
      And knew no end thereof.

    Glory touched glory on each blessed head,
      Hands locked dear hands never to sunder more:
    These were the new-begotten from the dead
      Whom the great birthday bore.

    Heart answered heart, soul answered soul at rest,
      Double against each other, filled, sufficed:
    All loving, loved of all; but loving best
      And best beloved of Christ.

    I saw that one who lost her love in pain,
      Who trod on thorns, who drank the loathsome cup;
    The lost in night, in day was found again;
      The fallen was lifted up.

    They stood together in the blessed noon,
      They sang together through the length of days;
    Each loving face bent Sunwards like a moon
      New-lit with love and praise.

    Therefore, O friend, I would not if I might
      Rebuild my house of lies, wherein I joyed
    One time to dwell: my soul shall walk in white,
      Cast down but not destroyed.

    Therefore in patience I possess my soul;
      Yea, therefore as a flint I set my face,
    To pluck down, to build up again the whole--
      But in a distant place.

    These thorns are sharp, yet I can tread on them;
      This cup is loathsome, yet He makes it sweet;
    My face is steadfast toward Jerusalem,
      My heart remembers it.

    I lift the hanging hands, the feeble knees--
      I, precious more than seven times molten gold--
    Until the day when from His storehouses
      God shall bring new and old;

    Beauty for ashes, oil of joy for grief,
      Garment of praise for spirit of heaviness:
    Although to-day I fade as doth a leaf,
      I languish and grow less.

    Although to-day He prunes my twigs with pain,
      Yet doth His blood nourish and warm my root:
    To-morrow I shall put forth buds again,
      And clothe myself with fruit.

    Although to-day I walk in tedious ways,
      To-day His staff is turned into a rod,
    Yet will I wait for Him the appointed days
      And stay upon my God.



    OLD AND NEW YEAR DITTIES.


    1.

    New Year met me somewhat sad:
      Old Year leaves me tired,
    Stripped of favorite things I had,
      Balked of much desired:
    Yet farther on my road to-day,
    God willing, farther on my way.

    New Year coming on apace
      What have you to give me?
    Bring you scathe, or bring you grace,
    Face me with an honest face;
      You shall not deceive me:
    Be it good or ill, be it what you will,
    It needs shall help me on my road,
    My rugged way to heaven, please God.


    2.

    Watch with me, men, women, and children dear,
    You whom I love, for whom I hope and fear,
    Watch with me this last vigil of the year.
    Some hug their business, some their pleasure-scheme;
    Some seize the vacant hour to sleep or dream;
    Heart locked in heart some kneel and watch apart.

    Watch with me, blessed spirits, who delight
    All through the holy night to walk in white,
    Or take your ease after the long-drawn fight.
    I know not if they watch with me: I know
    They count this eve of resurrection slow,
    And cry, "How long?" with urgent utterance strong.

    Watch with me, Jesus, in my loneliness:
    Though others say me nay, yet say Thou yes;
    Though others pass me by, stop Thou to bless.
    Yea, Thou dost stop with me this vigil night;
    To-night of pain, to-morrow of delight:
    I, Love, am Thine; Thou, Lord, my God, art mine.


    3.

    Passing away, saith the World, passing away:
    Chances, beauty and youth sapped day by day:
    Thy life never continueth in one stay.
    Is the eye waxen dim, is the dark hair changing to gray
    That hath won neither laurel nor bay?
    I shall clothe myself in Spring and bud in May:
    Thou, root-stricken, shalt not rebuild thy decay
    On my bosom for aye.
    Then I answered: Yea.

    Passing away, saith my Soul, passing away:
    With its burden of fear and hope, of labor and play;
    Hearken what the past doth witness and say:
    Rust in thy gold, a moth is in thine array,
    A canker is in thy bud, thy leaf must decay.
    At midnight, at cock-crow, at morning, one certain day
    Lo, the Bridegroom shall come and shall not delay:
    Watch thou and pray.
    Then I answered: Yea.

    Passing away, saith my God, passing away:
    Winter passeth after the long delay:
    New grapes on the vine, new figs on the tender spray,
    Turtle calleth turtle in Heaven's May.
    Though I tarry, wait for Me, trust Me, watch and pray.
    Arise, come away, night is past, and lo it is day,
    My love, My sister, My spouse, thou shalt hear Me say.
    Then I answered: Yea.



    AMEN.


    It is over. What is over?
      Nay, how much is over truly!--
    Harvest days we toiled to sow for;
      Now the sheaves are gathered newly,
      Now the wheat is garnered duly.

    It is finished. What is finished?
      Much is finished known or unknown:
    Lives are finished; time diminished;
      Was the fallow field left unsown?
      Will these buds be always unblown?

    It suffices. What suffices?
      All suffices reckoned rightly:
    Spring shall bloom where now the ice is,
      Roses make the bramble sightly,
      And the quickening sun shine brightly,
      And the latter wind blow lightly,
    And my garden teem with spices.



    MOTHER COUNTRY.


    Oh what is that country
      And where can it be,
    Not mine own country,
      But dearer far to me?
    Yet mine own country,
      If I one day may see
    Its spices and cedars,
      Its gold and ivory.

    As I lie dreaming
      It rises, that land;
    There rises before me
      Its green golden strand,
    With the bowing cedars
      And the shining sand;
    It sparkles and flashes
      Like a shaken brand.

    Do angels lean nearer
      While I lie and long?
    I see their soft plumage
      And catch their windy song,
    Like the rise of a high tide
      Sweeping full and strong;
    I mark the outskirts
      Of their reverend throng.

    Oh what is a king here,
      Or what is a boor?
    Here all starve together,
      All dwarfed and poor;
    Here Death's hand knocketh
      At door after door,
    He thins the dancers
      From the festal floor.

    Oh what is a handmaid,
      Or what is a queen?
    All must lie down together
      Where the turf is green,
    The foulest face hidden,
      The fairest not seen;
    Gone as if never
      They had breathed or been.

    Gone from sweet sunshine
      Underneath the sod,
    Turned from warm flesh and blood
      To senseless clod;
    Gone as if never
      They had toiled or trod,
    Gone out of sight of all
      Except our God.

    Shut into silence
      From the accustomed song
    Shut into solitude
      From all earth's throng,
    Run down though swift of foot,
      Thrust down though strong;
    Life made an end of,
      Seemed it short or long.

    Life made an end of,
      Life but just begun;
    Life finished yesterday,
      Its last sand run;
    Life new-born with the morrow
      Fresh as the sun:
    While done is done for ever;
      Undone, undone.

    And if that life is life,
      This is but a breath,
    The passage of a dream
      And the shadow of death;
    But a vain shadow
      If one considereth;
    Vanity of vanities,
      As the Preacher saith.




THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS, ETC.




    THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.


    Till all sweet gums and juices flow,
    Till the blossom of blossoms blow,
    The long hours go and come and go,
      The bride she sleepeth, waketh, sleepeth,
    Waiting for one whose coming is slow:--
        Hark! the bride weepeth.

    "How long shall I wait, come heat come rime?"--
    "Till the strong Prince comes, who must come in time,"
    Her women say. "There's a mountain to climb,
      A river to ford. Sleep, dream and sleep:
    Sleep," they say: "we've muffled the chime,
        Better dream than weep."

    In his world-end palace the strong Prince sat,
    Taking his ease on cushion and mat,
    Close at hand lay his staff and his hat
      "When wilt thou start? the bride waits, O youth."--
    "Now the moon's at full; I tarried for that,
        Now I start in truth.

    "But tell me first, true voice of my doom,
    Of my veiled bride in her maiden bloom;
    Keeps she watch through glare and through gloom,
      Watch for me asleep and awake?"--
    "Spell-bound she watches in one white room,
        And is patient for thy sake.

    "By her head lilies and rosebuds grow;
    The lilies droop,--will the rosebuds blow?
    The silver slim lilies hang the head low;
      Their stream is scanty, their sunshine rare;
    Let the sun blaze out, and let the stream flow,
        They will blossom and wax fair.

    "Red and white poppies grow at her feet,
    The blood-red wait for sweet summer heat,
    Wrapped in bud-coats hairy and neat;
      But the white buds swell; one day they will burst,
    Will open their death-cups drowsy and sweet,--
        Which will open the first?"

    Then a hundred sad voices lifted a wail,
    And a hundred glad voices piped on the gale:
    "Time is short, life is short," they took up the tale:
      "Life is sweet, love is sweet, use to-day while you may;
    Love is sweet, and to-morrow may fail;
        Love is sweet, use to-day."

    While the song swept by, beseeching and meek,
    Up rose the Prince with a flush on his cheek,
    Up he rose to stir and to seek,
      Going forth in the joy of his strength;
    Strong of limb, if of purpose weak,
        Starting at length.

    Forth he set in the breezy morn,
    Across green fields of nodding corn,
    As goodly a Prince as ever was born,
      Carolling with the carolling lark;--
    Sure his bride will be won and worn,
        Ere fall of the dark.

    So light his step, so merry his smile,
    A milkmaid loitered beside a stile,
    Set down her pail and rested awhile,
      A wave-haired milkmaid, rosy and white;
    The Prince, who had journeyed at least a mile,
        Grew athirst at the sight.

    "Will you give me a morning draught?"--
    "You're kindly welcome," she said, and laughed.
    He lifted the pail, new milk he quaffed;
      Then wiping his curly black beard like silk:
    "Whitest cow that ever was calved
        Surely gave you this milk."

    Was it milk now, or was it cream?
    Was she a maid, or an evil dream?
    Her eyes began to glitter and gleam;
      He would have gone, but he stayed instead;
    Green they gleamed as he looked in them:
        "Give me my fee," she said.--

    "I will give you a jewel of gold."--
    "Not so; gold is heavy and cold."--
    "I will give you a velvet fold
      Of foreign work your beauty to deck."--
    "Better I like my kerchief rolled
        Light and white round my neck."--

    "Nay," cried he, "but fix your own fee."--
    She laughed, "You may give the full moon to me;
    Or else sit under this apple-tree
      Here for one idle day by my side;
    After that I'll let you go free,
        And the world is wide."

    Loath to stay, but to leave her slack,
    He half turned away, then he quite turned back:
    For courtesy's sake he could not lack
      To redeem his own royal pledge;
    Ahead, too, the windy heaven lowered black
        With a fire-cloven edge.

    So he stretched his length in the apple-tree shade,
    Lay and laughed and talked to the maid,
    Who twisted her hair in a cunning braid,
      And writhed it in shining serpent-coils,
    And held him a day and night fast laid
          In her subtle toils.

    At the death of night and the birth of day,
    When the owl left off his sober play,
    And the bat hung himself out of the way,
      Woke the song of mavis and merle,
    And heaven put off its hodden gray
        For mother-o'-pearl.

    Peeped up daisies here and there,
    Here, there, and everywhere;
    Rose a hopeful lark in the air,
      Spreading out towards the sun his breast;
    While the moon set solemn and fair
        Away in the west.

    "Up, up, up," called the watchman lark,
    In his clear réveillée: "Hearken, O hark!
    Press to the high goal, fly to the mark.
      Up, O sluggard, new morn is born;
    If still asleep when the night falls dark,
        Thou must wait a second morn."

    "Up, up, up," sad glad voices swelled:
    "So the tree falls and lies as it's felled.
    Be thy bands loosed, O sleeper, long held
      In sweet sleep whose end is not sweet.
    Be the slackness girt and the softness quelled
        And the slowness fleet."

    Off he set. The grass grew rare,
    A blight lurked in the darkening air,
    The very moss grew hueless and spare,
      The last daisy stood all astunt;
    Behind his back the soil lay bare,
        But barer in front.

    A land of chasm and rent, a land
    Of rugged blackness on either hand:
    If water trickled, its track was tanned
      With an edge of rust to the chink;
    If one stamped on stone or on sand
        It returned a clink.

    A lifeless land, a loveless land,
    Without lair or nest on either hand:
    Only scorpions jerked in the sand,
      Black as black iron, or dusty pale;
    From point to point sheer rock was manned
        By scorpions in mail.

    A land of neither life nor death,
    Where no man buildeth or fashioneth,
    Where none draws living or dying breath;
      No man cometh or goeth there,
    No man doeth, seeketh, saith,
        In the stagnant air.

    Some old volcanic upset must
    Have rent the crust and blackened the crust;
    Wrenched and ribbed it beneath its dust
      Above earth's molten centre at seethe,
    Heaved and heaped it by huge upthrust
        Of fire beneath.

    Untrodden before, untrodden since:
    Tedious land for a social Prince;
    Halting, he scanned the outs and ins,
      Endless, labyrinthine, grim,
    Of the solitude that made him wince,
      Laying wait for him.

    By bulging rock and gaping cleft,
    Even of half mere daylight reft,
    Rueful he peered to right and left,
      Muttering in his altered mood:
    "The fate is hard that weaves my weft,
        Though my lot be good."

    Dim the changes of day to night,
    Of night scarce dark to day not bright.
    Still his road wound towards the right,
      Still he went, and still he went,
    Till one night he spied a light,
        In his discontent.

    Out it flashed from a yawn-mouthed cave,
    Like a red-hot eye from a grave.
    No man stood there of whom to crave
      Rest for wayfarer plodding by:
    Though the tenant were churl or knave
        The Prince might try.

    In he passed and tarried not,
    Groping his way from spot to spot,
    Towards where the cavern flare glowed hot:--
      An old, old mortal, cramped and double,
    Was peering into a seething-pot,
        In a world of trouble.

    The veriest atomy he looked,
    With grimy fingers clutching and crooked,
    Tight skin, a nose all bony and hooked,
      And a shaking, sharp, suspicious way;
    Blinking, his eyes had scarcely brooked
        The light of day.

    Stared the Prince, for the sight was new;
    Stared, but asked without more ado:
    "May a weary traveller lodge with you,
      Old father, here in your lair?
    In your country the inns seem few,
        And scanty the fare."

    The head turned not to hear him speak;
    The old voice whistled as through a leak
    (Out it came in a quavering squeak):
      "Work for wage is a bargain fit:
    If there's aught of mine that you seek
        You must work for it.

    "Buried alive from light and air
    This year is the hundredth year,
    I feed my fire with a sleepless care,
      Watching my potion wane or wax:
    Elixir of Life is simmering there,
        And but one thing lacks.

    "If you're fain to lodge here with me,
    Take that pair of bellows you see,--
    Too heavy for my old hands they be,--
      Take the bellows and puff and puff:
    When the steam curls rosy and free
        The broth's boiled enough.

    "Then take your choice of all I have;
    I will give you life if you crave.
    Already I'm mildewed for the grave,
      So first myself I must drink my fill:
    But all the rest may be yours, to save
        Whomever you will."

    "Done," quoth the Prince, and the bargain stood.
    First he piled on resinous wood,
    Next plied the bellows in hopeful mood;
      Thinking, "My love and I will live.
    If I tarry, why life is good,
        And she may forgive."

    The pot began to bubble and boil;
    The old man cast in essence and oil,
    He stirred all up with a triple coil
      Of gold and silver and iron wire,
    Dredged in a pinch of virgin soil,
        And fed the fire.

    But still the steam curled watery white;
    Night turned to day and day to night;
    One thing lacked, by his feeble sight
      Unseen, unguessed by his feeble mind:
    Life might miss him, but Death the blight
        Was sure to find.

    So when the hundredth year was full
    The thread was cut and finished the school.
    Death snapped the old worn-out tool,
      Snapped him short while he stood and stirred
    (Though stiff he stood as a stiff-necked mule)
        With never a word.

    Thus at length the old crab was nipped.
    The dead hand slipped, the dead finger dipped
    In the broth as the dead man slipped,--
      That same instant, a rosy red
    Flushed the steam, and quivered and clipped
        Round the dead old head.

    The last ingredient was supplied
    (Unless the dead man mistook or lied).
    Up started the Prince, he cast aside
      The bellows plied through the tedious trial,
    Made sure that his host had died,
        And filled a phial.

    "One night's rest," thought the Prince. "This done,
    Forth I speed with the rising sun:
    With the morrow I rise and run,
      Come what will of wind or of weather.
    This draught of Life when my Bride is won
        We'll drink together."

    Thus the dead man stayed in his grave,
    Self-chosen, the dead man in his cave;
    There he stayed, were he fool or knave,
      Or honest seeker who had not found;
    While the Prince outside was prompt to crave
        Sleep on the ground.

    "If she watches, go bid her sleep;
    Bid her sleep, for the road is steep:
    He can sleep who holdeth her cheap,
      Sleep and wake and sleep again.
    Let him sow, one day he shall reap,
        Let him sow the grain.

    "When there blows a sweet garden rose,
    Let it bloom and wither if no man knows:
    But if one knows when the sweet thing blows,
      Knows, and lets it open and drop,
    If but a nettle his garden grows
        He hath earned the crop."

    Through his sleep the summons rang,
    Into his ears it sobbed and it sang.
    Slow he woke with a drowsy pang,
      Shook himself without much debate,
    Turned where he saw green branches hang,
        Started though late.

    For the black land was travelled o'er,
    He should see the grim land no more.
    A flowering country stretched before
      His face when the lovely day came back:
    He hugged the phial of Life he bore,
        And resumed his track.

    By willow courses he took his path,
    Spied what a nest the kingfisher hath,
    Marked the fields green to aftermath,
      Marked where the red-brown field-mouse ran,
    Loitered awhile for a deep-stream bath,
        Yawned for a fellow-man.

    Up on the hills not a soul in view,
    In the vale not many nor few;
    Leaves, still leaves, and nothing new.
      It's O for a second maiden, at least,
    To bear the flagon, and taste it too,
        And flavor the feast.

    Lagging he moved, and apt to swerve;
    Lazy of limb, but quick of nerve.
    At length the water-bed took a curve,
      The deep river swept its bank-side bare;
    Waters streamed from the hill-reserve,--
        Waters here, waters there.

    High above, and deep below,
    Bursting, bubbling, swelling the flow,
    Like hill-torrents after the snow,--
      Bubbling, gurgling, in whirling strife,
    Swaying, sweeping, to and fro,--
        He must swim for his life.

    Which way?--which way?--his eyes grew dim
    With the dizzying whirl,--which way to swim?
    The thunderous downshoot deafened him;
      Half he choked in the lashing spray:
    Life is sweet, and the grave is grim,--
        Which way?--which way?

    A flash of light, a shout from the strand:
    "This way,--this way; here lies the land!"
    His phial clutched in one drowning hand;
      He catches,--misses,--catches a rope;
    His feet slip on the slipping sand:
        Is there life?--is there hope?

    Just saved, without pulse or breath,--
    Scarcely saved from the gulp of death;
    Laid where a willow shadoweth,--
      Laid where a swelling turf is smooth.
    (O Bride! but the Bridegroom lingereth
        For all thy sweet youth.)

    Kind hands do and undo,
    Kind voices whisper and coo:
    "I will chafe his hands,"--"and I,"--"and you
      Raise his head, put his hair aside."
    (If many laugh, one well may rue:
        Sleep on, thou Bride.)

    So the Prince was tended with care:
    One wrung foul ooze from his clustered hair;
    Two chafed his hands, and did not spare;
      But one propped his head that drooped awry
    Till his eyes oped, and at unaware
        They met eye to eye.

    O, a moon face in a shadowy place,
    And a light touch and a winsome grace,
    And a thrilling tender voice which says:
      "Safe from waters that seek the sea,--
    Cold waters by rugged ways,--
        Safe with me."

    While overhead bird whistles to bird,
    And round about plays a gamesome herd:
    "Safe with us,"--some take up the word,--
      "Safe with us, dear lord and friend:
    All the sweeter if long deferred
        Is rest in the end."

    Had he stayed to weigh and to scan,
    He had been more or less than a man:
    He did what a young man can,
    Spoke of toil and an arduous way,--
    Toil to-morrow, while golden ran
        The sands of to-day.

    Slip past, slip fast,
    Uncounted hours from first to last,
    Many hours till the last is past,
      Many hours dwindling to one,--
    One hour whose die is cast,
        One last hour gone.

    Come, gone,--gone forever,--
    Gone as an unreturning river,--
    Gone as to death the merriest liver,--
      Gone as the year at the dying fall,--
    To-morrow, to-day, yesterday, never,--
        Gone once for all.

    Came at length the starting-day,
    With last words, and last, last words to say,
    With bodiless cries from far away,--
      Chiding wailing voices that rang
    Like a trumpet-call to the tug and fray;
        And thus they sang:

    "Is there life?--the lamp burns low;
    Is there hope?--the coming is slow:
    The promise promised so long ago,
      The long promise, has not been kept.
    Does she live?--does she die?--she slumbers so
        Who so oft has wept.

    "Does she live?--does she die?--she languisheth
    As a lily drooping to death,
    As a drought-worn bird with failing breath,
      As a lovely vine without a stay,
    As a tree whereof the owner saith,
        'Hew it down to-day.'"

    Stung by that word the Prince was fain
    To start on his tedious road again.
    He crossed the stream where a ford was plain,
      He clomb the opposite bank though steep,
    And swore to himself to strain and attain
        Ere he tasted sleep.

    Huge before him a mountain frowned
    With foot of rock on the valley ground,
    And head with snows incessant crowned,
      And a cloud mantle about its strength,
    And a path which the wild goat hath not found
        In its breadth and length.

    But he was strong to do and dare:
    If a host had withstood him there,
    He had braved a host with little care
      In his lusty youth and his pride,
    Tough to grapple though weak to snare.
        He comes, O Bride.

    Up he went where the goat scarce clings,
    Up where the eagle folds her wings,
    Past the green line of living things,
      Where the sun cannot warm the cold,--
    Up he went as a flame enrings
        Where there seems no hold.

    Up a fissure barren and black,
    Till the eagles tired upon his track,
    And the clouds were left behind his back,--
      Up till the utmost peak was past.
    Then he gasped for breath and his strength fell slack;
        He paused at last.

    Before his face a valley spread
    Where fatness laughed, wine, oil, and bread,
    Where all fruit-trees their sweetness shed,
      Where all birds made love to their kind,
    Where jewels twinkled, and gold lay red
        And not hard to find.

    Midway down the mountain side
    (On its green slope the path was wide)
    Stood a house for a royal bride,
      Built all of changing opal stone,
    The royal palace, till now descried
        In his dreams alone.

    Less bold than in days of yore,
    Doubting now though never before,
    Doubting he goes and lags the more:
      Is the time late? does the day grow dim?
    Rose, will she open the crimson core
        Of her heart to him?

    Above his head a tangle glows
    Of wine-red roses, blushes, snows,
    Closed buds and buds that unclose,
      Leaves, and moss, and prickles too;
    His hand shook as he plucked a rose,
        And the rose dropped dew.

    Take heart of grace! the portion of Life
    May go far to woo him a wife:
    If she frown, yet a lover's strife
      Lightly raised can be laid again:
    A hasty word is never the knife
        To cut love in twain.

    Far away stretched the royal land,
    Fed by dew, by a spice-wind fanned:
    Light labor more, and his foot would stand
      On the threshold, all labor done;
    Easy pleasure laid at his hand,
        And the dear Bride won.

    His slackening steps pause at the gate,--
    Does she wake or sleep?--the time is late,--
    Does she sleep now, or watch and wait?
      She has watched, she has waited long,
    Watching athwart the golden grate
        With a patient song.

    Fling the golden portals wide,
    The Bridegroom comes to his promised Bride;
    Draw the gold-stiff curtains aside,
      Let them look on each other's face,
    She in her meekness, he in his pride,--
        Day wears apace.

    Day is over, the day that wore.
    What is this that comes through the door,
    The face covered, the feet before?
      This that coming takes his breath;
    This Bride not seen, to be seen no more
        Save of Bridegroom Death?

    Veiled figures carrying her
    Sweep by yet make no stir;
    There is a smell of spice and myrrh,
      A bride-chant burdened with one name;
    The bride-song rises steadier
        Than the torches' flame:

    "Too late for love, too late for joy,
      Too late, too late!
    You loitered on the road too long,
      You trifled at the gate:
    The enchanted dove upon her branch
        Died without a mate;
    The enchanted princess in her tower
      Slept, died, behind the grate;
    Her heart was starving all this while
        You made it wait.

    "Ten years ago, five years ago,
      One year ago,
    Even then you had arrived in time,
      Though somewhat slow;
    Then you had known her living face
      Which now you cannot know:
    The frozen fountain would have leaped,
      The buds gone on to blow,
    The warm south wind would have awaked
        To melt the snow.

    "Is she fair now as she lies?
      Once she was fair;
    Meet queen for any kingly king,
      With gold-dust on her hair.
    Now these are poppies in her locks,
      White poppies she must wear;
    Must wear a veil to shroud her face
      And the want graven there:
    Or is the hunger fed at length,
        Cast off the care?

    "We never saw her with a smile
      Or with a frown;
    Her bed seemed never soft to her,
      Though tossed of down;
    She little heeded what she wore,
      Kirtle, or wreath, or gown;
    We think her white brows often ached
      Beneath her crown,
    Till silvery hairs showed in her locks
      That used to be so brown.

    "We never heard her speak in haste:
      Her tones were sweet,
    And modulated just so much
      As it was meet:
    Her heart sat silent through the noise
      And concourse of the street.
    There was no hurry in her hands,
      No hurry in her feet;
    There was no bliss drew nigh to her,
      That she might run to greet.

    "You should have wept her yesterday,
      Wasting upon her bed:
    But wherefore should you weep to-day
      That she is dead?
    Lo, we who love weep not to-day,
      But crown her royal head.
    Let be these poppies that we strew,
      Your roses are too red:
    Let be these poppies, not for you
      Cut down and spread."





    MAIDEN-SONG.


    Long ago and long ago,
      And long ago still,
    There dwelt three merry maidens
      Upon a distant hill.
    One was tall Meggan,
      And one was dainty May,
    But one was fair Margaret,
      More fair than I can say,
    Long ago and long ago.

    When Meggan plucked the thorny rose,
      And when May pulled the brier,
    Half the birds would swoop to see,
      Half the beasts draw nigher;
    Half the fishes of the streams
      Would dart up to admire:
    But when Margaret plucked a flag-flower,
      Or poppy hot aflame,
    All the beasts and all the birds
      And all the fishes came
    To her hand more soft than snow.

    Strawberry leaves and May-dew
      In brisk morning air,
    Strawberry leaves and May-dew
      Make maidens fair.
    "I go for strawberry-leaves,"
      Meggan said one day:
    "Fair Margaret can bide at home,
      But you come with me, May;
    Up the hill and down the hill,
      Along the winding way,
    You and I are used to go."

    So these two fair sisters
      Went with innocent will
    Up the hill and down again,
      And round the homestead hill:
    While the fairest sat at home,
      Margaret like a queen,
    Like a blush-rose, like the moon
      In her heavenly sheen,
    Fragrant-breathed as milky cow
      Or field of blossoming bean,
    Graceful as an ivy bough
      Born to cling and lean;
    Thus she sat to sing and sew.

    When she raised her lustrous eyes
      A beast peeped at the door;
    When she downward cast her eyes
      A fish gasped on the floor;
    When she turned away her eyes
      A bird perched on the sill,
    Warbling out its heart of love,
      Warbling, warbling still,
    With pathetic pleadings low.

    Light-foot May with Meggan
      Sought the choicest spot,
    Clothed with thyme-alternate grass:
      Then, while day waxed hot,
    Sat at ease to play and rest,
      A gracious rest and play;
    The loveliest maidens near or far,
      When Margaret was away,
    Who sat at home to sing and sew.

    Sun-glow flushed their comely cheeks,
      Wind-play tossed their hair,
    Creeping things among the grass
      Stroked them here and there;
    Meggan piped a merry note,
      A fitful, wayward lay,
    While shrill as bird on topmost twig
      Piped merry May;
    Honey-smooth the double flow.

    Sped a herdsman from the vale,
      Mounting like a flame,
    All on fire to hear and see
      With floating locks he came.
    Looked neither north nor south,
      Neither east nor west,
    But sat him down at Meggan's feet
      As love-bird on his nest,
    And wooed her with a silent awe,
      With trouble not expressed;
    She sang the tears into his eyes,
      The heart out of his breast:
    So he loved her, listening so.

    She sang the heart out of his breast,
      The words out of his tongue;
    Hand and foot and pulse he paused
      Till her song was sung.
    Then he spoke up from his place
      Simple words and true:
    "Scanty goods have I to give,
      Scanty skill to woo;
    But I have a will to work,
      And a heart for you:
    Bid me stay or bid me go."

    Then Meggan mused within herself:
      "Better be first with him,
    Than dwell where fairer Margaret sits,
      Who shines my brightness dim,
    Forever second where she sits,
      However fair I be:
    I will be lady of his love,
      And he shall worship me;
    I will be lady of his herds
      And stoop to his degree,
    At home where kids and fatlings grow."

    Sped a shepherd from the height
      Headlong down to look,
    (White lambs followed, lured by love
      Of their shepherd's crook):
    He turned neither east nor west,
      Neither north nor south,
    But knelt right down to May, for love
      Of her sweet-singing mouth;
    Forgot his flocks, his panting flocks
      In parching hillside drouth;
    Forgot himself for weal or woe.

    Trilled her song and swelled her song
      With maiden coy caprice
    In a labyrinth of throbs,
      Pauses, cadences;
    Clear-noted as a dropping brook,
      Soft-noted like the bees,
    Wild-noted as the shivering wind
      Forlorn through forest trees:
    Love-noted like the wood-pigeon
      Who hides herself for love,
    Yet cannot keep her secret safe,
      But cooes and cooes thereof:
    Thus the notes rang loud or low.

    He hung breathless on her breath;
      Speechless, who listened well;
    Could not speak or think or wish
      Till silence broke the spell.
    Then he spoke, and spread his hands
      Pointing here and there:
    "See my sheep and see the lambs,
      Twin lambs which they bare.
    All myself I offer you,
      All my flocks and care,
    Your sweet song hath moved me so."

    In her fluttered heart young May
      Mused a dubious while:
    "If he loves me as he says"--
      Her lips curved with a smile:
    "Where Margaret shines like the sun,
      I shine but like a moon;
    If sister Meggan makes her choice
      I can make mine as soon;
    At cockcrow we were sister-maids,
      We may be brides at noon."
    Said Meggan, "Yes"; May said not "No."

    Fair Margaret stayed alone at home,
      Awhile she sang her song,
    Awhile sat silent, then she thought:
      "My sisters loiter long."
    That sultry noon had waned away,
      Shadows had waxen great:
    "Surely," she thought within herself,
      "My sisters loiter late."
    She rose, and peered out at the door,
      With patient heart to wait,
    And heard a distant nightingale
      Complaining of its mate;
    Then down the garden slope she walked,
      Down to the garden gate,
    Leaned on the rail and waited so.

    The slope was lightened by her eyes
      Like summer lightning fair,
    Like rising of the haloed moon
      Lightened her glimmering hair,
    While her face lightened like the sun
      Whose dawn is rosy white.
    Thus crowned with maiden majesty
      She peered into the night,
    Looked up the hill and down the hill,
      To left hand and to right,
    Flashing like fire-flies to and fro.

    Waiting thus in weariness
      She marked the nightingale
    Telling, if any one would heed,
      Its old complaining tale.
    Then lifted she her voice and sang,
      Answering the bird:
    Then lifted she her voice and sang,
      Such notes were never heard
    From any bird when Spring's in blow.

    The king of all that country
      Coursing far, coursing near,
    Curbed his amber-bitted steed,
      Coursed amain to hear;
    All his princes in his train,
      Squire, and knight, and peer,
    With his crown upon his head,
      His sceptre in his hand,
    Down he fell at Margaret's knees
      Lord king of all that land,
    To her highness bending low.

    Every beast and bird and fish
      Came mustering to the sound,
    Every man and every maid
      From miles of country round:
    Meggan on her herdsman's arm,
      With her shepherd, May,
    Flocks and herds trooped at their heels
      Along the hillside way;
    No foot too feeble for the ascent,
      Not any head too gray;
    Some were swift and none were slow.

    So Margaret sang her sisters home
      In their marriage mirth;
    Sang free birds out of the sky,
      Beasts along the earth,
    Sang up fishes of the deep,--
      All breathing things that move
    Sang from far and sang from near
      To her lovely love;
    Sang together friend and foe;

    Sang a golden-bearded king
      Straightway to her feet,
    Sang him silent where he knelt
      In eager anguish sweet.
    But when the clear voice died away,
      When longest echoes died,
    He stood up like a royal man
      And claimed her for his bride.
    So three maids were wooed and won
      In a brief May-tide,
    Long ago and long ago.



    JESSIE CAMERON.


    "Jessie, Jessie Cameron,
       Hear me but this once," quoth he.
    "Good luck go with you, neighbor's son,
      But I'm no mate for you," quoth she.
    Day was verging toward the night
      There beside the moaning sea,
    Dimness overtook the light
      There where the breakers be.
    "O Jessie, Jessie Cameron,
      I have loved you long and true."--
    "Good luck go with you, neighbor's son,
      But I'm no mate for you."

    She was a careless, fearless girl,
      And made her answer plain;
    Outspoken she to earl or churl,
      Kind-hearted in the main,
    But somewhat heedless with her tongue,
      And apt at causing pain;
    A mirthful maiden she and young,
      Most fair for bliss or bane.
    "O, long ago I told you so,
      I tell you so to-day:
    Go you your way, and let me go
      Just my own free way."

    The sea swept in with moan and foam
      Quickening the stretch of sand;
    They stood almost in sight of home;
      He strove to take her hand.
    "O, can't you take your answer then,
      And won't you understand?
    For me you're not the man of men,
      I've other plans are planned.
    You're good for Madge, or good for Cis,
      Or good for Kate, may be:
    But what's to me the good of this
      While you're not good for me?"

    They stood together on the beach,
      They two alone,
    And louder waxed his urgent speech,
      His patience almost gone:
    "O, say but one kind word to me,
      Jessie, Jessie Cameron."--
    "I'd be too proud to beg," quoth she,
      And pride was in her tone.
    And pride was in her lifted head,
      And in her angry eye,
    And in her foot, which might have fled,
      But would not fly.

    Some say that he had gypsy blood,
      That in his heart was guile:
    Yet he had gone through fire and flood
      Only to win her smile.
    Some say his grandam was a witch,
      A black witch from beyond the Nile,
    Who kept an image in a niche
      And talked with it the while.
    And by her hut far down the lane
      Some say they would not pass at night,
    Lest they should hear an unked strain
      Or see an unked sight.

    Alas, for Jessie Cameron!--
      The sea crept moaning, moaning nigher:
    She should have hastened to be gone,--
      The sea swept higher, breaking by her:
    She should have hastened to her home
      While yet the west was flushed with fire,
    But now her feet are in the foam,
      The sea-foam, sweeping higher.
    O mother, linger at your door,
      And light your lamp to make it plain;
    But Jessie she comes home no more,
      No more again.

    They stood together on the strand,
      They only, each by each;
    Home, her home, was close at hand,
      Utterly out of reach.
    Her mother in the chimney nook
      Heard a startled sea-gull screech,
    But never turned her head to look
      Towards the darkening beach:
    Neighbors here and neighbors there
      Heard one scream, as if a bird
    Shrilly screaming cleft the air:--
      That was all they heard.

    Jessie she comes home no more,
      Comes home never;
    Her lover's step sounds at his door
      No more forever.
    And boats may search upon the sea
      And search along the river,
    But none know where the bodies be:
      Sea-winds that shiver,
    Sea-birds that breast the blast,
      Sea-waves swelling,
    Keep the secret first and last
      Of their dwelling.

    Whether the tide so hemmed them round
      With its pitiless flow,
    That when they would have gone they found
      No way to go;
    Whether she scorned him to the last
      With words flung to and fro,
    Or clung to him when hope was past,
      None will ever know:
    Whether he helped or hindered her,
      Threw up his life or lost it well,
    The troubled sea, for all its stir,
      Finds no voice to tell.

    Only watchers by the dying
      Have thought they heard one pray,
    Wordless, urgent; and replying,
      One seem to say him nay:
    And watchers by the dead have heard
      A windy swell from miles away,
    With sobs and screams, but not a word
      Distinct for them to say:
    And watchers out at sea have caught
      Glimpse of a pale gleam here or there,
    Come and gone as quick as thought,
      Which might be hand or hair.



    SPRING QUIET.


    Gone were but the Winter,
      Come were but the Spring,
    I would go to a covert
      Where the birds sing;

    Where in the white-thorn
      Singeth a thrush,
    And a robin sings
      In the holly-bush.

    Full of fresh scents
      Are the budding boughs,
    Arching high over
      A cool green house:

    Full of sweet scents,
      And whispering air
    Which sayeth softly:
      "We spread no snare;

    "Here dwell in safety,
      Here dwell alone,
    With a clear stream
      And a mossy stone.

    "Here the sun shineth
      Most shadily;
    Here is heard an echo
      Of the far sea,
      Though far off it be."



    THE POOR GHOST.


    "O whence do you come, my dear friend, to me,
    With your golden hair all fallen below your knee,
    And your face as white as snowdrops on the lea,
    And your voice as hollow as the hollow sea?"

    "From the other world I come back to you,
    My locks are uncurled with dripping, drenching dew.
    You know the old, whilst I know the new:
    But to-morrow you shall know this too."

    "O, not to-morrow into the dark, I pray;
    O, not to-morrow, too soon to go away:
    Here I feel warm and well-content and gay:
    Give me another year, another day."

    "Am I so changed in a day and a night
    That mine own only love shrinks from me with fright,
    Is fain to turn away to left or right,
    And cover up his eyes from the sight?"

    "Indeed I loved you, my chosen friend,
    I loved you for life, but life has an end;
    Through sickness I was ready to tend;
    But death mars all, which we cannot mend.

    "Indeed I loved you; I love you yet
    If you will stay where your bed is set,
    Where I have planted a violet
    Which the wind waves, which the dew makes wet."

    "Life is gone, then love too is gone,
    It was a reed that I leant upon:
    Never doubt I will leave you alone
    And not wake you rattling bone with bone.

    "I go home alone to my bed,
    Dug deep at the foot and deep at the head,
    Roofed in with a load of lead,
    Warm enough for the forgotten dead.

    "But why did your tears soak through the clay,
    And why did your sobs wake me where I lay?
    I was away, far enough away:
    Let me sleep now till the Judgment Day."



    A PORTRAIT.


    I.

    She gave up beauty in her tender youth,
      Gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways;
      She covered up her eyes lest they should gaze
    On vanity, and chose the bitter truth.
    Harsh towards herself, towards others full of ruth,
      Servant of servants, little known to praise,
      Long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days:
    She schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth,
    That with the poor and stricken she might make
      A home, until the least of all sufficed
    Her wants; her own self learned she to forsake,
    Counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss.
    So with calm will she chose and bore the cross,
      And hated all for love of Jesus Christ.


    II.

    They knelt in silent anguish by her bed,
      And could not weep; but calmly there she lay.
      All pain had left her; and the sun's last ray
    Shone through upon her, warming into red
    The shady curtains. In her heart she said:
      "Heaven opens; I leave these and go away:
      The Bridegroom calls,--shall the Bride seek to stay?"
    Then low upon her breast she bowed her head.
    O lily-flower, O gem of priceless worth,
      O dove with patient voice and patient eyes,
    O fruitful vine amid a land of dearth,
      O maid replete with loving purities,
    Thou bowedst down thy head with friends on earth
      To raise it with the saints in Paradise.



    DREAM-LOVE.


    Young Love lies sleeping
      In May-time of the year,
    Among the lilies,
      Lapped in the tender light:
    White lambs come grazing,
      White doves come building there;
    And round about him
      The May-bushes are white.

    Soft moss the pillow
      For O, a softer cheek;
    Broad leaves cast shadow
      Upon the heavy eyes:
    There winds and waters
      Grow lulled and scarcely speak;
    There twilight lingers
      The longest in the skies.

    Young Love lies dreaming;
      But who shall tell the dream?
    A perfect sunlight
      On rustling forest tips;
    Or perfect moonlight
      Upon a rippling stream;
    Or perfect silence,
      Or song of cherished lips.

    Burn odors round him
      To fill the drowsy air;
    Weave silent dances
      Around him to and fro;
    For O, in waking,
      The sights are not so fair,
    And song and silence
      Are not like these below.

    Young Love lies dreaming
      Till summer days are gone,
    Dreaming and drowsing
      Away to perfect sleep:
    He sees the beauty
      Sun hath not looked upon,
    And tastes the fountain
      Unutterably deep.

    Him perfect music
      Doth hush unto his rest,
    And through the pauses
      The perfect silence calms:
    O, poor the voices
      Of earth from east to west,
    And poor earth's stillness
      Between her stately palms.

    Young Love lies drowsing
      Away to poppied death;
    Cool shadows deepen
      Across the sleeping face:
    So fails the summer
      With warm, delicious breath;
    And what hath autumn
      To give us in its place?

    Draw close the curtains
      Of branched evergreen;
    Change cannot touch them
      With fading fingers sere:
    Here the first violets
      Perhaps will bud unseen,
    And a dove, maybe,
      Return to nestle here.



    TWICE.


    I took my heart in my hand
      (O my love, O my love),
    I said: Let me fall or stand,
      Let me live or die,
    But this once hear me speak
      (O my love, O my love);
    Yet a woman's words are weak:
      You should speak, not I.

    You took my heart in your hand
      With a friendly smile,
    With a critical eye you scanned,
      Then set it down,
    And said: It is still unripe,
      Better wait awhile;
    Wait while the skylarks pipe,
      Till the corn grows brown.

    As you set it down it broke,--
      Broke, but I did not wince;
    I smiled at the speech you spoke,
      At your judgment that I heard:
    But I have not often smiled
      Since then, nor questioned since,
    Nor cared for corn-flowers wild,
      Nor sung with the singing bird.

    I take my heart in my hand,
      O my God, O my God,
    My broken heart in my hand:
      Thou hast seen, judge Thou.
    My hope was written on sand,
      O my God, O my God;
    Now let Thy judgment stand,--
      Yea, judge me now.

    This contemned of a man,
      This marred one heedless day,
    This heart take Thou to scan
      Both within and without:
    Refine with fire its gold,
      Purge Thou its dross away,--
    Yea, hold it in Thy hold,
      Whence none can pluck it out.

    I take my heart in my hand,--
      I shall not die, but live,--
    Before Thy face I stand;
      I, for Thou callest such:
    All that I have I bring,
      All that I am I give,
    Smile Thou and I shall sing,
      But shall not question much.



    SONGS IN A CORNFIELD.


    A song in a cornfield
      Where corn begins to fall,
    Where reapers are reaping,
      Reaping one, reaping all.
    Sing pretty Lettice,
      Sing Rachel, sing May;
    Only Marian cannot sing
      While her sweetheart's away.

    Where is he gone to
      And why does he stay?
    He came across the green sea
      But for a day,
    Across the deep green sea
      To help with the hay.
    His hair was curly yellow
      And his eyes were gray,
    He laughed a merry laugh
      And said a sweet say.
    Where is he gone to
      That he comes not home?
    To-day or to-morrow
      He surely will come.
    Let him haste to joy
      Lest he lag for sorrow,
    For one weeps to-day
      Who'll not weep to-morrow:

    To-day she must weep
      For gnawing sorrow,
    To-night she may sleep
      And not wake to-morrow.

    May sang with Rachel
      In the waxing warm weather,
    Lettice sang with them,
      They sang all together:--

    "Take the wheat in your arm
      Whilst day is broad above,
    Take the wheat to your bosom,
      But not a false false love.
      Out in the fields
        Summer heat gloweth,
      Out in the fields
        Summer wind bloweth,
      Out in the fields
        Summer friend showeth,
      Out in the fields
        Summer wheat groweth:
    But in the winter
      When summer heat is dead
    And summer wind has veered
      And summer friend has fled,
    Only summer wheat remaineth,
      White cakes and bread.
    Take the wheat, clasp the wheat
      That's food for maid and dove;
        Take the wheat to your bosom,
          But not a false false love."

    A silence of full noontide heat
      Grew on them at their toil:
    The farmer's dog woke up from sleep,
      The green snake hid her coil
    Where grass stood thickest; bird and beast
      Sought shadows as they could,
    The reaping men and women paused
      And sat down where they stood;
    They ate and drank and were refreshed,
      For rest from toil is good.

    While the reapers took their ease,
      Their sickles lying by,
    Rachel sang a second strain,
      And singing seemed to sigh:--

        "There goes the swallow,--
        Could we but follow!
          Hasty swallow stay,
          Point us out the way;
    Look back swallow, turn back swallow, stop swallow.

        "There went the swallow,--
        Too late to follow:
          Lost our note of way,
          Lost our chance to-day;
    Good by swallow, sunny swallow, wise swallow.

        "After the swallow
        All sweet things follow:
          All things go their way,
          Only we must stay,
    Must not follow: good by swallow, good swallow."

    Then listless Marian raised her head
      Among the nodding sheaves;
    Her voice was sweeter than that voice;
      She sang like one who grieves:
    Her voice was sweeter than its wont
      Among the nodding sheaves;
    All wondered while they heard her sing
      Like one who hopes and grieves:--

      "Deeper than the hail can smite,
      Deeper than the frost can bite,
      Deep asleep through day and night,
        Our delight.

      "Now thy sleep no pang can break,
      No to-morrow bid thee wake,
      Not our sobs who sit and ache
        For thy sake.

      "Is it dark or light below?
      O, but is it cold like snow?
      Dost thou feel the green things grow
        Fast or slow?

      "Is it warm or cold beneath,
      O, but is it cold like death?
      Cold like death, without a breath,
        Cold like death?"

      If he comes to-day
        He will find her weeping;
      If he comes to-morrow
        He will find her sleeping;
      If he comes the next day
        He'll not find her at all,
      He may tear his curling hair,
        Beat his breast and call.



    A YEAR'S WINDFALLS.


    On the wind of January
      Down flits the snow,
    Travelling from the frozen North
      As cold as it can blow.
    Poor robin redbreast,
      Look where he comes;
    Let him in to feel your fire,
      And toss him of your crumbs.

    On the wind in February
      Snow-flakes float still,
    Half inclined to turn to rain,
      Nipping, dripping, chill.
    Then the thaws swell the streams,
      And swollen rivers swell the sea:--
    If the winter ever ends
      How pleasant it will be.

    In the wind of windy March
      The catkins drop down,
    Curly, caterpillar-like,
      Curious green and brown.
    With concourse of nest-building birds
      And leaf-buds by the way,
    We begin to think of flowers
      And life and nuts some day.

    With the gusts of April
      Rich fruit-tree blossoms fall,
    On the hedged-in orchard-green,
      From the southern wall.
    Apple-trees and pear-trees
      Shed petals white or pink,
    Plum-trees and peach-trees;
      While sharp showers sink and sink.

    Little brings the May breeze
      Beside pure scent of flowers,
    While all things wax and nothing wanes
      In lengthening daylight hours.
    Across the hyacinth beds
      The wind lags warm and sweet,
    Across the hawthorn tops,
      Across the blades of wheat.

    In the wind of sunny June
      Thrives the red rose crop,
    Every day fresh blossoms blow
      While the first leaves drop;
    White rose and yellow rose
      And moss-rose choice to find,
    And the cottage cabbage-rose
      Not one whit behind.

    On the blast of scorched July
      Drives the pelting hail,
    From thunderous lightning-clouds, that blot
      Blue heaven grown lurid-pale.
    Weedy waves are tossed ashore,
      Sea-things strange to sight
    Gasp upon the barren shore
      And fade away in light.

    In the parching August wind,
      Cornfields bow the head,
    Sheltered in round valley depths,
      On low hills outspread.
    Early leaves drop loitering down
      Weightless on the breeze,
    First-fruits of the year's decay
      From the withering trees.

    In brisk wind of September
      The heavy-headed fruits
    Shake upon their bending boughs
      And drop from the shoots;
    Some glow golden in the sun,
      Some show green and streaked
    Some set forth a purple bloom,
      Some blush rosy-cheeked.

    In strong blast of October
      At the equinox,
    Stirred up in his hollow bed
      Broad ocean rocks;
    Plunge the ships on his bosom,
      Leaps and plunges the foam,--
    It's O for mothers' sons at sea,
      That they were safe at home!

    In slack wind of November
      The fog forms and shifts;
    All the world comes out again
      When the fog lifts.
    Loosened from their sapless twigs
      Leaves drop with every gust;
    Drifting, rustling, out of sight
      In the damp or dust.

    Last of all, December,
      The year's sands nearly run,
    Speeds on the shortest day,
      Curtails the sun;
    With its bleak raw wind
      Lays the last leaves low,
    Brings back the nightly frosts,
      Brings back the snow.



    THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.


    How comes it, Flora, that, whenever we
    Play cards together, you invariably,
      However the pack parts,
      Still hold the Queen of Hearts?

    I've scanned you with a scrutinizing gaze,
    Resolved to fathom these your secret ways:
      But, sift them as I will,
      Your ways are secret still.

    I cut and shuffle; shuffle, cut, again;
    But all my cutting, shuffling, proves in vain:
      Vain hope, vain forethought, too;
      That Queen still falls to you.

    I dropped her once, prepense; but, ere the deal
    Was dealt, your instinct seemed her loss to feel:
      "There should be one card more,"
      You said, and searched the floor.

    I cheated once: I made a private notch
    In Heart-Queen's back, and kept a lynx-eyed watch;
      Yet such another back
      Deceived me in the pack:

    The Queen of Clubs assumed by arts unknown
    An imitative dint that seemed my own;
      This notch, not of my doing,
      Misled me to my ruin.

    It baffles me to puzzle out the clew,
    Which must be skill, or craft, or luck in you:
      Unless, indeed, it be
      Natural affinity.



    ONE DAY.


    I will tell you when they met:
    In the limpid days of Spring;
    Elder boughs were budding yet,
    Oaken boughs looked wintry still,
    But primrose and veined violet
    In the mossful turf were set,
    While meeting birds made haste to sing
    And build with right good will.

    I will tell you when they parted:
    When plenteous Autumn sheaves were brown,
    Then they parted heavy-hearted;
    The full rejoicing sun looked down
    As grand as in the days before;
    Only they had lost a crown;
    Only to them those days of yore
    Could come back nevermore.

    When shall they meet? I cannot tell,
    Indeed, when they shall meet again,
    Except some day in Paradise:
    For this they wait, one waits in pain.
    Beyond the sea of death love lies
    Forever, yesterday, to-day;
    Angels shall ask them, "Is it well?"
    And they shall answer, "Yea."



    A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW.


    "Croak, croak, croak,"
    Thus the Raven spoke,
    Perched on his crooked tree
    As hoarse as hoarse could be.
    Shun him and fear him,
    Lest the Bridegroom hear him;
    Scout him and rout him
    With his ominous eye about him.

    Yet, "Croak, croak, croak,"
    Still tolled from the oak;
    From that fatal black bird,
    Whether heard or unheard:
    "O ship upon the high seas,
    Freighted with lives and spices,
    Sink, O ship," croaked the Raven:
    "Let the Bride mount to heaven."

    In a far foreign land
    Upon the wave-edged sand,
    Some friends gaze wistfully
    Across the glittering sea.
    "If we could clasp our sister,"
    Three say, "now we have missed her!"
    "If we could kiss our daughter!"
    Two sigh across the water.

    O, the ship sails fast,
    With silken flags at the mast,
    And the home-wind blows soft;
    But a Raven sits aloft,
    Chuckling and choking,
    Croaking, croaking, croaking:--
    Let the beacon-fire blaze higher;
    Bridegroom, watch; the Bride draws nigher.

    On a sloped sandy beach,
    Which the spring-tide billows reach,
    Stand a watchful throng
    Who have hoped and waited long:
    "Fie on this ship, that tarries
    With the priceless freight it carries.
    The time seems long and longer:
    O languid wind, wax stronger";--

    Whilst the Raven perched at ease
    Still croaks and does not cease,
    One monotonous note
    Tolled from his iron throat:
    "No father, no mother,
    But I have a sable brother:
    He sees where ocean flows to,
    And he knows what he knows, too."

    A day and a night
    They kept watch worn and white;
    A night and a day
    For the swift ship on its way:
    For the Bride and her maidens,--
    Clear chimes the bridal cadence,--
    For the tall ship that never
    Hove in sight forever.

    On either shore, some
    Stand in grief loud or dumb
    As the dreadful dread
    Grows certain though unsaid.
    For laughter there is weeping,
    And waking instead of sleeping,
    And a desperate sorrow
    Morrow after morrow.

    O, who knows the truth,
    How she perished in her youth,
    And like a queen went down
    Pale in her royal crown?
    How she went up to glory
    From the sea-foam chill and hoary,
    From the sea-depth black and riven
    To the calm that is in Heaven?

    They went down, all the crew,
    The silks and spices too,
    The great ones and the small,
    One and all, one and all.
    Was it through stress of weather,
    Quicksands, rocks, or all together?
    Only the Raven knows this,
    And he will not disclose this.--

    After a day and a year
    The bridal bells chime clear;
    After a year and a day
    The Bridegroom is brave and gay:
    Love is sound, faith is rotten;
    The old Bride is forgotten:--
    Two ominous Ravens only
    Remember, black and lonely.




    THE GERMAN-FRENCH CAMPAIGN.

    1870-1871.

These two pieces, written during the suspense of a great nation's agony,
aim at expressing human sympathy, not political bias.


    I.

    "THY BROTHER'S BLOOD CRIETH."


    All her corn-fields rippled in the sunshine,
      All her lovely vines, sweets-laden, bowed;
    Yet some weeks to harvest and to vintage:
      When, as one man's hand, a cloud
    Rose and spread, and, blackening, burst asunder
          In rain and fire and thunder.

    Is there nought to reap in the day of harvest?
      Hath the vine in her day no fruit to yield?
    Yea, men tread the press, but not for sweetness,
      And they reap a red crop from the field.
    Build barns, ye reapers, garner all aright,
          Though your souls be called to-night.

    A cry of tears goes up from blackened homesteads,
      A cry of blood goes up from reeking earth:
    Tears and blood have a cry that pierces Heaven
      Through all its Hallelujah swells of mirth;
    God hears their cry, and though He tarry, yet
          He doth not forget.

    Mournful Mother, prone in dust weeping,
      Who shall comfort thee for those who are not?
    As thou didst, men do to thee; and heap the measure,
      And heat the furnace sevenfold hot:
    As thou once, now these to thee--who pitieth thee
          From sea to sea?

    O thou King, terrible in strength, and building
      Thy strong future on thy past!
    Though he drink the last, the King of Sheshach,
      Yet he shall drink at the last.
    Art thou greater than great Babylon,
          Which lies overthrown?

    Take heed, ye unwise among the people;
      O ye fools, when will ye understand?--
    He that planted the ear shall He not hear,
      Nor He smite who formed the hand?
    "Vengeance is Mine, is Mine," thus saith the Lord:--
          O Man, put up thy sword.



    II.

    "TO-DAY FOR ME."


      She sitteth still who used to dance,
    She weepeth sore and more and more--
    Let us sit with thee weeping sore,
        O fair France!

      She trembleth as the days advance
    Who used to be so light of heart:--
    We in thy trembling bear a part,
        Sister France!

      Her eyes shine tearful as they glance:
    "Who shall give back my slaughtered sons?
    "Bind up," she saith, "my wounded ones."--
        Alas, France!

      She struggles in a deathly trance,
    As in a dream her pulses stir,
    She hears the nations calling her,
        "France, France, France!"

      Thou people of the lifted lance,
    Forbear her tears, forbear her blood:
    Roll back, roll back, thy whelming flood,
        Back from France.

      Eye not her loveliness askance,
    Forge not for her a galling chain;
    Leave her at peace to bloom again,
        Vine-clad France.

      A time there is for change and chance,
    A time for passing of the cup:
    And One abides can yet bind up
        Broken France.

      A time there is for change and chance:
    Who next shall drink the trembling cup,
    Wring out its dregs and suck them up
        After France?




    ON THE WING.

    SONNET.


    Once in a dream (for once I dreamed of you)
      We stood together in an open field;
      Above our heads two swift-winged pigeons wheeled,
    Sporting at ease and courting full in view.
    When loftier still a broadening darkness flew,
      Down-swooping, and a ravenous hawk revealed;
      Too weak to fight, too fond to fly, they yield;
    So farewell life and love and pleasures new.
    Then, as their plumes fell fluttering to the ground,
      Their snow-white plumage flecked with crimson drops,
        I wept, and thought I turned towards you to weep:
      But you were gone; while rustling hedgerow tops
    Bent in a wind which bore to me a sound
        Of far-off piteous bleat of lambs and sheep.



    CONSIDER.


        Consider
    The lilies of the field whose bloom is brief:--
        We are as they;
        Like them we fade away,
    As doth a leaf.

        Consider
    The sparrows of the air of small account:
        Our God doth view
    Whether they fall or mount,--
        He guards us too.

        Consider
    The lilies that do neither spin nor toil,
        Yet are most fair:--
        What profits all this care
    And all this coil?

        Consider
    The birds that have no barn nor harvest-weeks;
        God gives them food:--
    Much more our Father seeks
        To do us good.



    BEAUTY IS VAIN.


    While roses are so red,
      While lilies are so white,
    Shall a woman exalt her face
      Because it gives delight?
    She's not so sweet as a rose,
      A lily's straighter than she,
    And if she were as red or white
      She'd be but one of three.

    Whether she flush in love's summer
      Or in its winter grow pale,
    Whether she flaunt her beauty
      Or hide it away in a veil,
    Be she red or white,
      And stand she erect or bowed,
    Time will win the race he runs with her
      And hide her away in a shroud.



    MAGGIE A LADY.


    You must not call me Maggie, you must not call me Dear,
      For I'm Lady of the Manor now stately to see;
    And if there comes a babe, as there may some happy year,
      'T will be little lord or lady at my knee.

    O, but what ails you, my sailor cousin Phil,
      That you shake and turn white like a cockcrow ghost?
    You're as white as I turned once down by the mill,
      When one told me you and ship and crew were lost:

    Philip my playfellow, when we were boy and girl
      (It was the Miller's Nancy told it to me),
    Philip with the merry life in lip and curl,
      Philip my playfellow drowned in the sea!

    I thought I should have fainted, but I did not faint;
      I stood stunned at the moment, scarcely sad,
    Till I raised my wail of desolate complaint
      For you, my cousin, brother, all I had.

    They said I looked so pale,--some say so fair,--
      My lord stopped in passing to soothe me back to life:
    I know I missed a ringlet from my hair
      Next morning; and now I am his wife.

    Look at my gown, Philip, and look at my ring,
      I'm all crimson and gold from top to toe:
    All day long I sit in the sun and sing,
      Where in the sun red roses blush and blow.

    And I'm the rose of roses says my lord;
      And to him I'm more than the sun in the sky,
    While I hold him fast with the golden cord
      Of a curl, with the eyelash of an eye.

    His mother said "fie," and his sisters cried "shame,"
      His high-born ladies cried "shame" from their place:
    They said "fie" when they only heard my name,
      But fell silent when they saw my face.

    Am I so fair, Philip? Philip, did you think
      I was so fair when we played boy and girl,
    Where blue forget-me-nots bloomed on the brink
      Of our stream which the mill-wheel sent awhirl?

    If I was fair then sure I'm fairer now,
      Sitting where a score of servants stand,
    With a coronet on high days for my brow
      And almost a sceptre for my hand.

    You're but a sailor, Philip, weatherbeaten brown,
      A stranger on land and at home on the sea,
    Coasting as best you may from town to town:
      Coasting along do you often think of me?

    I'm a great lady in a sheltered bower,
      With hands grown white through having naught to do:
    Yet sometimes I think of you hour after hour
      Till I nigh wish myself a child with you.



    WHAT WOULD I GIVE?


    What would I give for a heart of flesh to warm me through,
    Instead of this heart of stone ice-cold whatever I do;
    Hard and cold and small, of all hearts the worst of all.

    What would I give for words, if only words would come;
    But now in its misery my spirit has fallen dumb:
    O, merry friends, go your way, I have never a word to say.

    What would I give for tears, not smiles but scalding tears,
    To wash the black mark clean, and to thaw the frost of years,
    To wash the stain ingrain and to make me clean again.



    THE BOURNE.


    Underneath the growing grass,
      Underneath the living flowers,
      Deeper than the sound of showers:
      There we shall not count the hours
    By the shadows as they pass.

    Youth and health will be but vain,
      Beauty reckoned of no worth:
      There a very little girth
      Can hold round what once the earth
    Seemed too narrow to contain.



    SUMMER.


    Winter is cold-hearted,
      Spring is yea and nay,
    Autumn is a weathercock
      Blown every way:
    Summer days for me
      When every leaf is on its tree;

    When Robin's not a beggar,
      And Jenny Wren's a bride,
    And larks hang singing, singing, singing,
      Over the wheat-fields wide,
      And anchored lilies ride,
    And the pendulum spider
      Swings from side to side,

    And blue-black beetles transact business,
      And gnats fly in a host,
    And furry caterpillars hasten
      That no time be lost,
    And moths grow fat and thrive,
    And ladybirds arrive.

    Before green apples blush,
      Before green nuts embrown,
    Why, one day in the country
      Is worth a month in town;
      Is worth a day and a year
    Of the dusty, musty, lag-last fashion
      That days drone elsewhere.



    AUTUMN.


    I dwell alone,--I dwell alone, alone,
    Whilst full my river flows down to the sea,
      Gilded with flashing boats
        That bring no friend to me:
    O love-songs, gurgling from a hundred throats,
        O love-pangs, let me be.

    Fair fall the freighted boats which gold and stone
        And spices bear to sea:
    Slim, gleaming maidens swell their mellow notes,
        Love-promising, entreating,--
        Ah! sweet, but fleeting,--
      Beneath the shivering, snow-white sails.
      Hush! the wind flags and fails,--
    Hush! they will lie becalmed in sight of strand,--
      Sight of my strand, where I do dwell alone;
    Their songs wake singing echoes in my land,--
      They cannot hear me moan.

      One latest, solitary swallow flies
        Across the sea, rough autumn-tempest tost,
        Poor bird, shall it be lost?
      Dropped down into this uncongenial sea,
            With no kind eyes
            To watch it while it dies,
          Unguessed, uncared for, free:
            Set free at last,
            The short pang past,
    In sleep, in death, in dreamless sleep locked fast.

    Mine avenue is all a growth of oaks,
          Some rent by thunder-strokes,
    Some rustling leaves and acorns in the breeze:
          Fair fall my fertile trees,
    That rear their goodly heads, and live at ease.

    A spider's web blocks all mine avenue;
      He catches down and foolish painted flies,
          That spider wary and wise.
    Each morn it hangs a rainbow strung with dew
      Betwixt boughs green with sap,
      So fair, few creatures guess it is a trap:
          I will not mar the web,
    Though sad I am to see the small lives ebb.

    It shakes,--my trees shake; for a wind is roused
          In cavern where it housed:
          Each white and quivering sail,
          Of boats among the water leaves
    Hollows and strains in the full-throated gale:
          Each maiden sings again,--
    Each languid maiden, whom the calm
    Had lulled to sleep with rest and spice and balm,
          Miles down my river to the sea
            They float and wane,
          Long miles away from me.
          Perhaps they say: "She grieves,
            Uplifted, like a beacon, on her tower."
            Perhaps they say: "One hour
    More, and we dance among the golden sheaves."
            Perhaps they say: "One hour
              More, and we stand,
              Face to face, hand in hand;
    Make haste, O slack gale, to the looked-for land!"

            My trees are not in flower,
            I have no bower,
            And gusty creaks my tower,
    And lonesome, very lonesome, is my strand.



    THE GHOST'S PETITION.


    "There's a footstep coming: look out and see."--
      "The leaves are falling, the wind is calling;
    No one cometh across the lea."--

    "There's a footstep coming: O sister, look."--
      "The ripple flashes, the white foam dashes;
    No one cometh across the brook."--

    "But he promised that he would come:
      To-night, to-morrow, in joy or sorrow,
    He must keep his word, and must come home.

    "For he promised that he would come:
      His word was given; from earth or heaven,
    He must keep his word, and must come home.

    "Go to sleep, my sweet sister Jane;
      You can slumber, who need not number
    Hour after hour, in doubt and pain.

    "I shall sit here awhile, and watch;
      Listening, hoping, for one hand groping
    In deep shadow to find the latch."

    After the dark, and before the light,
      One lay sleeping; and one sat weeping,
    Who had watched and wept the weary night.

    After the night, and before the day,
      One lay sleeping; and one sat weeping,--
    Watching, weeping for one away.

    There came a footstep climbing the stair;
      Some one standing out on the landing
    Shook the door like a puff of air,--

    Shook the door, and in he passed.
      Did he enter? In the room centre
    Stood her husband: the door shut fast.

    "O Robin, but you are cold,--
      Chilled with the night-dew: so lily-white you
    Look like a stray lamb from our fold.

    "O Robin, but you are late:
      Come and sit near me,--sit here and cheer me."--
    (Blue the flame burnt in the grate.)

    "Lay not down your head on my breast:
      I cannot hold you, kind wife, nor fold you
    In the shelter that you love best.

    "Feel not after my clasping hand:
      I am but a shadow, come from the meadow
    Where many lie, but no tree can stand.

    "We are trees which have shed their leaves:
      Our heads lie low there, but no tears flow there;
    Only I grieve for my wife who grieves.

    "I could rest if you would not moan
      Hour after hour; I have no power
    To shut my ears where I lie alone.

    "I could rest if you would not cry;
      But there's no sleeping while you sit weeping,--
    Watching, weeping so bitterly."--

    "Woe's me! woe's me! for this I have heard.
      O, night of sorrow!--O, black to-morrow!
    Is it thus that you keep your word?

    "O you who used so to shelter me
      Warm from the least wind,--why, now the east wind
    Is warmer than you, whom I quake to see.

    "O my husband of flesh and blood,
      For whom my mother I left, and brother,
    And all I had, accounting it good,

    "What do you do there, underground,
      In the dark hollow? I'm fain to follow.
    What do you do there?--what have you found?"--

    "What I do there I must not tell;
      But I have plenty. Kind wife, content ye:
    It is well with us,--it is well.

    "Tender hand hath made our nest;
      Our fear is ended, our hope is blended
    With present pleasure, and we have rest."--

    "O, but Robin, I'm fain to come,
      If your present days are so pleasant;
    For my days are so wearisome.

    "Yet I'll dry my tears for your sake:
      Why should I tease you, who cannot please you
    Any more with the pains I take?"



    MEMORY.


    I.

    I nursed it in my bosom while it lived,
      I hid it in my heart when it was dead;
    In joy I sat alone, even so I grieved
        Alone and nothing said.

    I shut the door to face the naked truth,
      I stood alone,--I faced the truth alone,
    Stripped bare of self-regard or forms or ruth
        Till first and last were shown.

    I took the perfect balances and weighed;
      No shaking of my hand disturbed the poise;
    Weighed, found it wanting: not a word I said,
        But silent made my choice.

    None know the choice I made; I make it still.
      None know the choice I made and broke my heart,
    Breaking mine idol: I have braced my will
        Once, chosen for once my part.

    I broke it at a blow, I laid it cold,
      Crushed in my deep heart where it used to live.
    My heart dies inch by inch; the time grows old,
        Grows old in which I grieve.


    II.

    I have a room whereinto no one enters
      Save I myself alone:
      There sits a blessed memory on a throne,
    There my life centres.

    While winter comes and goes--O tedious comer!--
      And while its nip-wind blows;
      While bloom the bloodless lily and warm rose
    Of lavish summer.

    If any should force entrance he might see there
      One buried yet not dead,
      Before whose face I no more bow my head
    Or bend my knee there;

    But often in my worn life's autumn weather
      I watch there with clear eyes,
      And think how it will be in Paradise
    When we're together.



    A ROYAL PRINCESS.


    I, a princess, king-descended, decked with jewels, gilded, drest,
    Would rather be a peasant with her baby at her breast,
    For all I shine so like the sun, and am purple like the west.

    Two and two my guards behind, two and two before,
    Two and two on either hand, they guard me evermore;
    Me, poor dove, that must not coo,--eagle, that must not soar.

    All my fountains cast up perfumes, all my gardens grow
    Scented woods and foreign spices, with all flowers in blow
    That are costly, out of season as the seasons go.

    All my walls are lost in mirrors, whereupon I trace
    Self to right hand, self to left hand, self in every place,
    Self-same solitary figure, self-same seeking face.

    Then I have an ivory chair high to sit upon,
    Almost like my father's chair, which is an ivory throne;
    There I sit uplift and upright, there I sit alone.

    Alone by day, alone by night, alone days without end;
    My father and my mother give me treasures, search and spend--
    O my father! O my mother! have you ne'er a friend?

    As I am a lofty princess, so my father is
    A lofty king, accomplished in all kingly subtilties,
    Holding in his strong right hand world-kingdoms' balances.

    He has quarrelled with his neighbors, he has scourged his foes;
    Vassal counts and princes follow where his pennon goes,
    Long-descended valiant lords whom the vulture knows,

    On whose track the vulture swoops, when they ride in state
    To break the strength of armies and topple down the great:
    Each of these my courteous servant, none of these my mate.

    My father counting up his strength sets down with equal pen
    So many head of cattle, head of horses, head of men;
    These for slaughter, these for labor, with the how and when.

    Some to work on roads, canals; some to man his ships;
    Some to smart in mines beneath sharp overseers' whips;
    Some to trap fur-beasts in lands where utmost winter nips.

    Once it came into my heart and whelmed me like a flood,
    That these too are men and women, human flesh and blood;
    Men with hearts and men with souls, though trodden down like mud.

    Our feasting was not glad that night, our music was not gay;
    On my mother's graceful head I marked a thread of gray,
    My father frowning at the fare seemed every dish to weigh.

    I sat beside them sole princess in my exalted place,
    My ladies and my gentlemen stood by me on the dais:
    A mirror showed me I look old and haggard in the face;

    It showed me that my ladies all are fair to gaze upon,
    Plump, plenteous-haired, to every one love's secret lore is known,
    They laugh by day, they sleep by night; ah me, what is a throne?

    The singing men and women sang that night as usual,
    The dancers danced in pairs and sets, but music had a fall,
    A melancholy windy fall as at a funeral.

    Amid the toss of torches to my chamber back we swept;
    My ladies loosed my golden chain; meantime I could have wept
    To think of some in galling chains whether they waked or slept.

    I took my bath of scented milk, delicately waited on,
    They burned sweet things for my delight, cedar and cinnamon,
    They lit my shaded silver lamp and left me there alone.

    A day went by, a week went by. One day I heard it said:
    "Men are clamoring, women, children, clamoring to be fed;
    Men like famished dogs are howling in the streets for bread."

    So two whispered by my door, not thinking I could hear,
    Vulgar, naked truth, ungarnished for a royal ear;
    Fit for cooping in the background, not to stalk so near.

    But I strained my utmost sense to catch this truth, and mark:
    "There are families out grazing like cattle in the park."
    "A pair of peasants must be saved even if we build an ark."

    A merry jest, a merry laugh, each strolled upon his way;
    One was my page, a lad I reared and bore with day by day;
    One was my youngest maid, as sweet and white as cream in May.

    Other footsteps followed softly with a weightier tramp;
    Voices said: "Picked soldiers have been summoned from the camp
    To quell these base-born ruffians who make free to howl and stamp."

    "Howl and stamp?" one answered: "They made free to hurl a stone
    At the minister's state coach, well aimed and stoutly thrown."
    "There's work, then, for the soldiers, for this rank crop must be mown."

    "One I saw, a poor old fool with ashes on his head,
    Whimpering because a girl had snatched his crust of bread:
    Then he dropped; when some one raised him, it turned out he was dead."

    "After us the deluge," was retorted with a laugh:
    "If bread's the staff of life, they must walk without a staff."
    "While I've a loaf they're welcome to my blessing and the chaff."

    These passed. The king: stand up. Said my father with a smile:
    "Daughter mine, your mother comes to sit with you awhile,
    She's sad to-day, and who but you her sadness can beguile?"

    He too left me. Shall I touch my harp now while I wait
    (I hear them doubling guard below before our palace gate),
    Or shall I work the last gold stitch into my veil of state;

    Or shall my woman stand and read some unimpassioned scene,
    There's music of a lulling sort in words that pause between;
    Or shall she merely fan me while I wait here for the queen?

    Again I caught my father's voice in sharp word of command:
    "Charge!" a clash of steel: "Charge again, the rebels stand.
    Smite and spare not, hand to hand; smite and spare not, hand to hand."

    There swelled a tumult at the gate, high voices waxing higher;
    A flash of red reflected light lit the cathedral spire;
    I heard a cry for faggots, then I heard a yell for fire.

    "Sit and roast there with your meat, sit and bake there with your bread,
    You who sat to see us starve," one shrieking woman said:
    "Sit on your throne and roast with your crown upon your head."

    Nay, this thing will I do, while my mother tarrieth,
    I will take my fine spun gold, but not to sew therewith,
    I will take my gold and gems, and rainbow fan and wreath;

    With a ransom in my lap, a king's ransom in my hand,
    I will go down to this people, will stand face to face, will stand
    Where they curse king, queen, and princess of this cursed land.

    They shall take all to buy them bread, take all I have to give;
    I, if I perish, perish; they to-day shall eat and live;
    I, if I perish, perish; that's the goal I half conceive:

    Once to speak before the world, rend bare my heart and show
    The lesson I have learned, which is death, is life, to know.
    I, if I perish, perish; in the name of God I go.



    SHALL I FORGET?


    Shall I forget on this side of the grave?
    I promise nothing: you must wait and see
          Patient and brave.
    (O my soul, watch with him and he with me.)

    Shall I forget in peace of Paradise?
    I promise nothing: follow, friend, and see,
          Faithful and wise.
    (O my soul, lead the way he walks with me.)



    VANITY OF VANITIES.

    SONNET.


    Ah, woe is me for pleasure that is vain,
      Ah, woe is me for glory that is past:
      Pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last,
    Glory that at the last bringeth no gain!
    So saith the sinking heart; and so again
      It shall say till the mighty angel-blast
      Is blown, making the sun and moon aghast,
    And showering down the stars like sudden rain.
    And evermore men shall go fearfully,
      Bending beneath their weight of heaviness;
    And ancient men shall lie down wearily,
      And strong men shall rise up in weariness;
    Yea, even the young shall answer sighingly,
      Saying one to another: How vain it is!



    L. E. L.

    "Whose heart was breaking for a little love."


    Down-stairs I laugh, I sport and jest with all:
      But in my solitary room above
    I turn my face in silence to the wall;
      My heart is breaking for a little love.
        Though winter frosts are done,
        And birds pair every one,
    And leaves peep out, for springtide is begun.

    I feel no spring, while spring is wellnigh blown,
      I find no nest, while nests are in the grove:
    Woe's me for mine own heart that dwells alone,
      My heart that breaketh for a little love.
        While golden in the sun
        Rivulets rise and run,
    While lilies bud, for springtide is begun.

    All love, are loved, save only I; their hearts
      Beat warm with love and joy, beat full thereof:
    They cannot guess, who play the pleasant parts,
      My heart is breaking for a little love.
        While beehives wake and whirr,
        And rabbit thins his fur,
    In living spring that sets the world astir.

    I deck myself with silks and jewelry,
      I plume myself like any mated dove:
    They praise my rustling show, and never see
      My heart is breaking for a little love.
        While sprouts green lavender
        With rosemary and myrrh,
    For in quick spring the sap is all astir.

    Perhaps some saints in glory guess the truth,
      Perhaps some angels read it as they move,
    And cry one to another full of ruth,
        "Her heart is breaking for a little love."
          Though other things have birth,
          And leap and sing for mirth,
    When spring-time wakes and clothes and feeds the earth.

    Yet saith a saint: "Take patience for thy scathe";
      Yet saith an angel: "Wait, for thou shalt prove
    True best is last, true life is born of death,
      O thou, heart-broken for a little love!
        Then love shall fill thy girth,
        And love make fat thy dearth,
    When new spring builds new heaven and clean new earth."



    LIFE AND DEATH.


    Life is not sweet. One day it will be sweet
        To shut our eyes and die:
    Nor feel the wild-flowers blow, nor birds dart by
        With flitting butterfly,
    Nor grass grow long above our heads and feet,
    Nor hear the happy lark that soars sky high,
    Nor sigh that spring is fleet and summer fleet,
        Nor mark the waxing wheat,
    Nor know who sits in our accustomed seat.

    Life is not good. One day it will be good
        To die, then live again;
    To sleep meanwhile: so not to feel the wane
    Of shrunk leaves dropping in the wood,
    Nor hear the foamy lashing of the main,
    Nor mark the blackened bean-fields, nor where stood
        Rich ranks of golden grain,
    Only dead refuse stubble clothe the plain:
    Asleep from risk, asleep from pain.



    BIRD OR BEAST?


    Did any bird come flying
      After Adam and Eve,
    When the door was shut against them
      And they sat down to grieve?

    I think not Eve's peacock
      Splendid to see,
    And I think not Adam's eagle;
      But a dove may be.

    Did any beast come pushing
      Through the thorny hedge
    Into the thorny, thistly world
      Out from Eden's edge?

    I think not a lion,
      Though his strength is such;
    But an innocent loving lamb
      May have done as much.

    If the dove preached from her bough
      And the lamb from his sod,
    The lamb and the dove
      Were preachers sent from God.



    EVE.


    "While I sit at the door,
    Sick to gaze within,
    Mine eye weepeth sore
    For sorrow and sin:
    As a tree my sin stands
    To darken all lands;
    Death is the fruit it bore.

    "How have Eden bowers grown
    Without Adam to bend them!
    How have Eden flowers blown,
    Squandering their sweet breath,
    Without me to tend them!
    The Tree of Life was ours,
    Tree twelvefold-fruited,
    Most lofty tree that flowers,
    Most deeply rooted:
    I chose the Tree of Death.

    "Hadst thou but said me nay,
    Adam, my brother,
    I might have pined away;
    I, but none other:
    God might have let thee stay
    Safe in our garden,
    By putting me away
    Beyond all pardon.

    "I, Eve, sad mother
    Of all who must live,
    I, not another,
    Plucked bitterest fruit to give
    My friend, husband, lover.
    O wanton eyes run over!
    Who but I should grieve?--
    Cain hath slain his brother:
    Of all who must die mother,
    Miserable Eve!"

    Thus she sat weeping,
    Thus Eve, our mother,
    Where one lay sleeping
    Slain by his brother.
    Greatest and least
    Each piteous beast
    To hear her voice
    Forgot his joys
    And set aside his feast.

    The mouse paused in his walk
    And dropped his wheaten stalk;
    Grave cattle wagged their heads
    In rumination;
    The eagle gave a cry
    From his cloud station;
    Larks on thyme beds
    Forbore to mount or sing;
    Bees drooped upon the wing;
    The raven perched on high
    Forgot his ration;
    The conies in their rock,
    A feeble nation,
    Quaked sympathetical;
    The mocking-bird left off to mock;
    Huge camels knelt as if
    In deprecation;
    The kind hart's tears were falling;
    Chattered the wistful stork;
    Dove-voices with a dying fall
    Cooed desolation,
    Answering grief by grief.

    Only the serpent in the dust,
    Wriggling and crawling,
    Grinned an evil grin, and thrust
    His tongue out with its fork.



    GROWN AND FLOWN.


    I loved my love from green of Spring
      Until sere Autumn's fall;
    But now that leaves are withering
      How should one love at all?
      One heart's too small
    For hunger, cold, love, everything.

    I loved my love on sunny days
      Until late Summer's wane;
    But now that frost begins to glaze
      How should one love again?
      Nay, love and pain
    Walk wide apart in diverse ways.

    I loved my love,--alas to see
      That this should be, alas!
    I thought that this could scarcely be,
      Yet has it come to pass:
      Sweet sweet love was,
    Now bitter bitter grown to me.



    A FARM WALK.


    The year stood at its equinox
      And bluff the North was blowing,
    A bleat of lambs came from the flocks,
      Green hardy things were growing;
    I met a maid with shining locks
      Where milky kine were lowing.

    She wore a kerchief on her neck,
      Her bare arm showed its dimple,
    Her apron spread without a speck,
      Her air was frank and simple.

    She milked into a wooden pail
      And sang a country ditty,
    An innocent fond lovers' tale,
      That was not wise nor witty,
    Pathetically rustical,
      Too pointless for the city.

    She kept in time without a beat
      As true as church-bell ringers,
    Unless she tapped time with her feet,
      Or squeezed it with her fingers;
    Her clear unstudied notes were sweet
      As many a practised singer's.

    I stood a minute out of sight,
      Stood silent for a minute
    To eye the pail, and creamy white
      The frothing milk within it;

    To eye the comely milking maid
      Herself so fresh and creamy:
    "Good day to you," at last I said;
      She turned her head to see me:
    "Good day," she said, with lifted head;
      Her eyes looked soft and dreamy,

    And all the while she milked and milked
      The grave cow heavy-laden:
    I've seen grand ladies plumed and silked,
      But not a sweeter maiden;

    But not a sweeter, fresher maid
      Than this in homely cotton,
    Whose pleasant face and silky braid
      I have not yet forgotten.

    Seven springs have passed since then, as I
      Count with a sober sorrow;
    Seven springs have come and passed me by,
      And spring sets in to-morrow.

    I've half a mind to shake myself
      Free just for once from London,
    To set my work upon the shelf
      And leave it done or undone;

    To run down by the early train,
      Whirl down with shriek and whistle,
    And feel the bluff North blow again,
      And mark the sprouting thistle
    Set up on waste patch of the lane
      Its green and tender bristle,

    And spy the scarce-blown violet banks,
      Crisp primrose leaves and others,
    And watch the lambs leap at their pranks
      And butt their patient mothers.

    Alas, one point in all my plan
      My serious thoughts demur to:
    Seven years have passed for maid and man,
      Seven years have passed for her too;

    Perhaps my rose is overblown,
      Not rosy or too rosy;
    Perhaps in farm-house of her own
      Some husband keeps her cosey,
    Where I should show a face unknown.
      Good by, my wayside posy.



    SOMEWHERE OR OTHER.


    Somewhere or other there must surely be
      The face not seen, the voice not heard,
    The heart that not yet--never yet--ah me!
        Made answer to my word.

    Somewhere or other, may be near or far;
      Past land and sea, clean out of sight;
    Beyond the wandering moon, beyond the star
        That tracks her night by night.

    Somewhere or other, may be far or near;
      With just a wall, a hedge, between;
    With just the last leaves of the dying year
        Fallen on a turf grown green.



    A CHILL.


      What can lambkins do
      All the keen night through?
    Nestle by their woolly mother,
      The careful ewe.

      What can nestlings do
      In the nightly dew?
    Sleep beneath their mother's wing
      Till day breaks anew.

      If in field or tree
      There might only be
    Such a warm soft sleeping-place
      Found for me!



    CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL.


    I WISH you were a pleasant wren,
      And I your small accepted mate;
    How we'd look down on toilsome men!
      We'd rise and go to bed at eight
      Or it may be not quite so late.

    Then you should see the nest I'd build,
      The wondrous nest for you and me;
    The outside rough, perhaps, but filled
      With wool and down: ah, you should see
      The cosey nest that it would be.

    We'd have our change of hope and fear,
      Small quarrels, reconcilements sweet:
    I'd perch by you to chirp and cheer,
      Or hop about on active feet
      And fetch you dainty bits to eat.

    We'd be so happy by the day,
      So safe and happy through the night,
    We both should feel, and I should say,
      It's all one season of delight,
    And we'll make merry whilst we may.

    Perhaps some day there'd be an egg
      When spring had blossomed from the snow:
    I'd stand triumphant on one leg;
      Like chanticleer I'd almost crow
      To let our little neighbors know.

    Next you should sit and I would sing
    Through lengthening days of sunny spring:
      Till, if you wearied of the task,
    I'd sit; and you should spread your wing
      From bough to bough; I'd sit and bask.

    Fancy the breaking of the shell,
      The chirp, the chickens wet and bare,
    The untried proud paternal swell;
      And you with housewife-matron air
      Enacting choicer bills of fare.

    Fancy the embryo coats of down,
      The gradual feathers soft and sleek;
    Till clothed and strong from tail to crown,
      With virgin warblings in their beak,
      They too go forth to soar and seek.

    So would it last an April through
    And early summer fresh with dew:
      Then should we part and live as twain,
    Love-time would bring me back to you
      And build our happy nest again.



    GONE FOREVER.


    O happy rose-bud blooming
      Upon thy parent tree,--
    Nay, thou art too presuming;
    For soon the earth entombing
      Thy faded charms shall be,
    And the chill damp consuming.

    O happy skylark springing
      Up to the broad blue sky,
    Too fearless in thy winging,
    Too gladsome in thy singing,
      Thou also soon shalt lie
    Where no sweet notes are ringing.

    And through life's shine and shower
      We shall have joy and pain;
    But in the summer bower,
    And at the morning hour,
      We still shall look in vain
    For the same bird and flower.



    UNDER THE ROSE.

    "The iniquity of the fathers upon the children."


    O the rose of keenest thorn!
    One hidden summer morn
    Under the rose I was born.

    I do not guess his name
    Who wrought my Mother's shame,
    And gave me life forlorn,
    But my Mother, Mother, Mother,
    I know her from all other.
    My Mother pale and mild,
    Fair as ever was seen,
    She was but scarce sixteen,
    Little more than a child,
    When I was born
    To work her scorn.
    With secret bitter throes,
    In a passion of secret woes,
    She bore me under the rose.

    One who my Mother nursed
    Took me from the first:--
    "O nurse, let me look upon
    This babe that cost so dear;
    To-morrow she will be gone:
    Other mothers may keep
    Their babes awake and asleep,
    But I must not keep her here."--
    Whether I know or guess,
    I know this not the less.

    So I was sent away
    That none might spy the truth:
    And my childhood waxed to youth
    And I left off childish play.
    I never cared to play
    With the village boys and girls;
    And I think they thought me proud,
    I found so little to say
    And kept so from the crowd:
    But I had the longest curls,
    And I had the largest eyes,
    And my teeth were small like pearls;
    The girls might flout and scout me,
    But the boys would hang about me
    In sheepish mooning wise.

    Our one-street village stood
    A long mile from the town,
    A mile of windy down
    And bleak one-sided wood,
    With not a single house.
    Our town itself was small,
    With just the common shops,
    And throve in its small way.
    Our neighboring gentry reared
    The good old-fashioned crops,
    And made old-fashioned boasts
    Of what John Bull would do
    If Frenchman Frog appeared,
    And drank old-fashioned toasts,
    And made old-fashioned bows
    To my Lady at the Hall.

    My Lady at the Hall
    Is grander than they all:
    Hers is the oldest name
    In all the neighborhood;
    But the race must die with her
    Though she's a lofty dame,
    For she's unmarried still.
    Poor people say she's good
    And has an open hand
    As any in the land,
    And she's the comforter
    Of many sick and sad;
    My nurse once said to me
    That everything she had
    Came of my Lady's bounty:
    "Though she's greatest in the county
    She's humble to the poor,
    No beggar seeks her door
    But finds help presently.
    I pray both night and day
    For her, and you must pray:
    But she'll never feel distress
    If needy folk can bless."
    I was a little maid
    When here we came to live
    From somewhere by the sea.
    Men spoke a foreign tongue
    There where we used to be
    When I was merry and young,
    Too young to feel afraid;
    The fisher-folk would give
    A kind strange word to me,
    There by the foreign sea:
    I don't know where it was,
    But I remember still
    Our cottage on a hill,
    And fields of flowering grass
    On that fair foreign shore.

    I liked my old home best,
    But this was pleasant too:
    So here we made our nest
    And here I grew.
    And now and then my Lady
    In riding past our door
    Would nod to nurse and speak,
    Or stoop and pat my cheek;
    And I was always ready
    To hold the field-gate wide
    For my Lady to go through;
    My Lady in her veil
    So seldom put aside,
    My Lady grave and pale.

    I often sat to wonder
    Who might my parents be,
    For I knew of something under
    My simple-seeming state.
    Nurse never talked to me
    Of mother or of father,
    But watched me early and late
    With kind suspicious cares:
    Or not suspicious, rather
    Anxious, as if she knew
    Some secret I might gather
    And smart for unawares.
    Thus I grew.

    But Nurse waxed old and gray,
    Bent and weak with years.
    There came a certain day
    That she lay upon her bed
    Shaking her palsied head,
    With words she gasped to say
    Which had to stay unsaid.
    Then with a jerking hand
    Held out so piteously
    She gave a ring to me
    Of gold wrought curiously,
    A ring which she had worn
    Since the day that I was born,
    She once had said to me:
    I slipped it on my finger;
    Her eyes were keen to linger
    On my hand that slipped it on;
    Then she sighed one rattling sigh
    And stared on with sightless eye:--
    The one who loved me was gone.

    How long I stayed alone
    With the corpse I never knew,
    For I fainted dead as stone:
    When I came to life once more
    I was down upon the floor,
    With neighbors making ado
    To bring me back to life.
    I heard the sexton's wife
    Say: "Up, my lad, and run
    To tell it at the Hall;
    She was my Lady's nurse,
    And done can't be undone.
    I'll watch by this poor lamb.
    I guess my Lady's purse
    Is always open to such:
    I'd run up on my crutch
    A cripple as I am,"
    (For cramps had vexed her much,)
    "Rather than this dear heart
    Lack one to take her part."

    For days, day after day,
    On my weary bed I lay,
    Wishing the time would pass;
    O, so wishing that I was
    Likely to pass away:
    For the one friend whom I knew
    Was dead, I knew no other,
    Neither father nor mother;
    And I, what should I do?

    One day the sexton's wife
    Said: "Rouse yourself, my dear:
    My Lady has driven down
    From the Hall into the town,
    And we think she's coming here.
    Cheer up, for life is life."

    But I would not look or speak,
    Would not cheer up at all.
    My tears were like to fall,
    So I turned round to the wall
    And hid my hollow cheek,
    Making as if I slept,
    As silent as a stone,
    And no one knew I wept.
    What was my Lady to me,
    The grand lady from the Hall?
    She might come, or stay away,
    I was sick at heart that day:
    The whole world seemed to be
    Nothing, just nothing to me,
    For aught that I could see.

    Yet I listened where I lay:
    A bustle came below,
    A clear voice said: "I know;
    I will see her first alone,
    It may be less of a shock
    If she's so weak to-day":--
    A light hand turned the lock,
    A light step crossed the floor,
    One sat beside my bed:
    But never a word she said.

    For me, my shyness grew
    Each moment more and more:
    So I said never a word
    And neither looked nor stirred;
    I think she must have heard
    My heart go pit-a-pat:
    Thus I lay, my Lady sat,
    More than a mortal hour
    (I counted one and two
    By the house-clock while I lay):
    I seemed to have no power
    To think of a thing to say,
    Or do what I ought to do,
    Or rouse myself to a choice.

    At last she said: "Margaret,
    Won't you even look at me?"
    A something in her voice
    Forced my tears to fall at last,
    Forced sobs from me thick and fast;
    Something not of the past,
    Yet stirring memory;
    A something new, and yet
    Not new, too sweet to last,
    Which I never can forget.

    I turned and stared at her:
    Her cheek showed hollow-pale;
    Her hair like mine was fair,
    A wonderful fall of hair
    That screened her like a veil;
    But her height was statelier,
    Her eyes had depth more deep:
    I think they must have had
    Always a something sad,
    Unless they were asleep.

    While I stared, my Lady took
    My hand in her spare hand,
    Jewelled and soft and grand,
    And looked with a long long look
    Of hunger in my face;
    As if she tried to trace
    Features she ought to know,
    And half hoped, half feared, to find.
    Whatever was in her mind
    She heaved a sigh at last,
    And began to talk to me.
    "Your nurse was my dear nurse,
    And her nursling's dear," said she:
    "No one told me a word
    Of her getting worse and worse,
    Till her poor life was past"
    (Here my Lady's tears dropped fast):
    "I might have been with her,
    I might have promised and heard,
    But she had no comforter.
    She might have told me much
    Which now I shall never know,
    Never, never shall know."
    She sat by me sobbing so,
    And seemed so woe-begone,
    That I laid one hand upon
    Hers with a timid touch,
    Scarce thinking what I did,
    Not knowing what to say:
    That moment her face was hid
    In the pillow close by mine,
    Her arm was flung over me,
    She hugged me, sobbing so
    As if her heart would break,
    And kissed me where I lay.

    After this she often came
    To bring me fruit or wine,
    Or sometimes hothouse flowers.
    And at nights I lay awake
    Often and often thinking
    What to do for her sake.
    Wet or dry it was the same:
    She would come in at all hours,
    Set me eating and drinking,
    And say I must grow strong;
    At last the day seemed long
    And home seemed scarcely home
    If she did not come.

    Well, I grew strong again:
    In time of primroses
    I went to pluck them in the lane;
    In time of nestling birds
    I heard them chirping round the house;
    And all the herds
    Were out at grass when I grew strong,
    And days were waxen long,
    And there was work for bees
    Among the May-bush boughs,
    And I had shot up tall,
    And life felt after all
    Pleasant, and not so long
    When I grew strong.

    I was going to the Hall
    To be my Lady's maid:
    "Her little friend," she said to me,
    "Almost her child,"
    She said and smiled,
    Sighing painfully;
    Blushing, with a second flush,
    As if she blushed to blush.

    Friend, servant, child: just this
    My standing at the Hall;
    The other servants call me "Miss,"
    My Lady calls me "Margaret,"
    With her clear voice musical.
    She never chides when I forget
    This or that; she never chides.
    Except when people come to stay
    (And that's not often) at the Hall,
    I sit with her all day
    And ride out when she rides.
    She sings to me and makes me sing;
    Sometimes I read to her,
    Sometimes we merely sit and talk.
    She noticed once my ring
    And made me tell its history:
    That evening in our garden walk
    She said she should infer
    The ring had been my father's first,
    Then my mother's, given for me
    To the nurse who nursed
    My mother in her misery,
    That so quite certainly
    Some one might know me, who--
    Then she was silent, and I too.

    I hate when people come:
    The women speak and stare
    And mean to be so civil.
    This one will stroke my hair,
    That one will pat my cheek
    And praise my Lady's kindness,
    Expecting me to speak;
    I like the proud ones best
    Who sit as struck with blindness,
    As if I wasn't there.
    But if any gentleman
    Is staying at the Hall
    (Though few come prying here),
    My Lady seems to fear
    Some downright dreadful evil,
    And makes me keep my room
    As closely as she can:
    So I hate when people come,
    It is so troublesome.
    In spite of all her care,
    Sometimes to keep alive
    I sometimes do contrive
    To get out in the grounds
    For a whiff of wholesome air,
    Under the rose you know:
    It's charming to break bounds,
    Stolen waters are sweet,
    And what's the good of feet
    If for days they mustn't go?
    Give me a longer tether,
    Or I may break from it.

    Now I have eyes and ears
    And just some little wit:
    "Almost my lady's child";
    I recollect she smiled,
    Sighed and blushed together;
    Then her story of the ring
    Sounds not improbable,
    She told it me so well
    It seemed the actual thing:--
    O keep your counsel close,
    But I guess under the rose,
    In long past summer weather
    When the world was blossoming,
    And the rose upon its thorn:
    I guess not who he was
    Flawed honor like a glass
    And made my life forlorn;
    But my Mother, Mother, Mother,
    O, I know her from all other.

    My Lady, you might trust
    Your daughter with your fame.
    Trust me, I would not shame
    Our honorable name,
    For I have noble blood
    Though I was bred in dust
    And brought up in the mud.
    I will not press my claim,
    Just leave me where you will:
    But you might trust your daughter,
    For blood is thicker than water
    And you're my mother still.

    So my Lady holds her own
    With condescending grace,
    And fills her lofty place
    With an untroubled face
    As a queen may fill a throne.
    While I could hint a tale
    (But then I am her child)
    Would make her quail;
    Would set her in the dust,
    Lorn with no comforter,
    Her glorious hair defiled
    And ashes on her cheek:
    The decent world would thrust
    Its finger out at her,
    Not much displeased I think
    To make a nine days' stir;
    The decent world would sink
    Its voice to speak of her.

    Now this is what I mean
    To do, no more, no less:
    Never to speak, or show
    Bare sign of what I know.
    Let the blot pass unseen;
    Yea, let her never guess
    I hold the tangled clew
    She huddles out of view.
    Friend, servant, almost child,
    So be it and nothing more
    On this side of the grave.
    Mother, in Paradise,
    You'll see with clearer eyes;
    Perhaps in this world even
    When you are like to die
    And face to face with Heaven
    You'll drop for once the lie:
    But you must drop the mask, not I.

    My Lady promises
    Two hundred pounds with me
    Whenever I may wed
    A man she can approve:
    And since besides her bounty
    I'm fairest in the county
    (For so I've heard it said,
    Though I don't vouch for this),
    Her promised pounds may move
    Some honest man to see
    My virtues and my beauties;
    Perhaps the rising grazier,
    Or temperance publican,
    May claim my wifely duties.
    Meanwhile I wait their leisure
    And grace-bestowing pleasure,
    I wait the happy man;
    But if I hold my head
    And pitch my expectations
    Just higher than their level,
    They must fall back on patience:
    I may not mean to wed,
    Yet I'll be civil.

    Now sometimes in a dream
    My heart goes out of me
    To build and scheme,
    Till I sob after things that seem
    So pleasant in a dream:
    A home such as I see
    My blessed neighbors live in
    With father and with mother,
    All proud of one another,
    Named by one common name,
    From baby in the bud
    To full-blown workman father;
    It's little short of Heaven.
    I'd give my gentle blood
    To wash my special shame
    And drown my private grudge;
    I'd toil and moil much rather
    The dingiest cottage drudge
    Whose mother need not blush,
    Than live here like a lady
    And see my Mother flush
    And hear her voice unsteady
    Sometimes, yet never dare
    Ask to share her care.

    Of course the servants sneer
    Behind my back at me;
    Of course the village girls,
    Who envy me my curls
    And gowns and idleness,
    Take comfort in a jeer;
    Of course the ladies guess
    Just so much of my history
    As points the emphatic stress
    With which they laud my Lady;
    The gentlemen who catch
    A casual glimpse of me
    And turn again to see,
    Their valets on the watch
    To speak a word with me,
    All know and sting me wild;
    Till I am almost ready
    To wish that I were dead,
    No faces more to see,
    No more words to be said,
    My Mother safe at last
    Disburdened of her child,
    And the past past.

    "All equal before God,"--
    Our Rector has it so,
    And sundry sleepers nod:
    It may be so; I know
    All are not equal here,
    And when the sleepers wake
    They make a difference.
    "All equal in the grave,"--
    That shows an obvious sense:
    Yet something which I crave
    Not death itself brings near;
    How should death half atone
    For all my past; or make
    The name I bear my own?

    I love my dear old Nurse
    Who loved me without gains;
    I love my mistress even,
    Friend, Mother, what you will:
    But I could almost curse
    My Father for his pains;
    And sometimes at my prayer,
    Kneeling in sight of Heaven,
    I almost curse him still:
    Why did he set his snare
    To catch at unaware
    My Mother's foolish youth;
    Load me with shame that's hers,
    And her with something worse,
    A lifelong lie for truth?

    I think my mind is fixed
    On one point and made up:
    To accept my lot unmixed;
    Never to drug the cup
    But drink it by myself.
    I'll not be wooed for pelf;
    I'll not blot out my shame
    With any man's good name;
    But nameless as I stand,
    My hand is my own hand,
    And nameless as I came
    I go to the dark land.

    "All equal in the grave,"--
    I bide my time till then:
    "All equal before God,"--
    To-day I feel His rod,
    To-morrow He may save:
                Amen.



    SONG.


    Oh what comes over the sea,
      Shoals and quicksands past;
    And what comes home to me,
      Sailing slow, sailing fast?

    A wind comes over the sea
      With a moan in its blast;
    But nothing comes home to me,
      Sailing slow, sailing fast.

    Let me be, let me be,
      For my lot is cast:
    Land or sea all's one to me,
      And sail it slow or fast.



    BY THE SEA.


    Why does the sea moan evermore?
      Shut out from heaven it makes its moan.
    It frets against the boundary shore;
      All earth's full rivers cannot fill
      The sea, that drinking thirsteth still.

    Sheer miracles of loveliness
      Lie hid in its unlooked-on bed:
    Anemones, salt, passionless,
      Blow flower-like; just enough alive
      To blow and multiply and thrive.

    Shells quaint with curve, or spot, or spike,
      Encrusted live things argus-eyed,
    All fair alike, yet all unlike,
      Are born without a pang, and die
      Without a pang,--and so pass by.



    DAYS OF VANITY.


      A dream that waketh,
      Bubble that breaketh,
    Song whose burden sigheth,
      A passing breath,
      Smoke that vanisheth,--
    Such is life that dieth.

      A flower that fadeth,
      Fruit the tree sheddeth,
    Trackless bird that flieth,
      Summer time brief,
      Falling of the leaf,--
    Such is life that dieth.

      A scent exhaling,
      Snow waters failing,
    Morning dew that drieth,
      A windy blast,
      Lengthening shadows cast,--
    Such is life that dieth.

      A scanty measure,
      Rust-eaten treasure,
    Spending that nought buyeth,
      Moth on the wing,
      Toil unprofiting,--
    Such is life that dieth.

      Morrow by morrow
      Sorrow breeds sorrow,
    For this my song sigheth;
      From day to night
      We lapse out of sight,--
    Such is life that dieth.



    ENRICA, 1865.


    She came among us from the South
      And made the North her home awhile
      Our dimness brightened in her smile,
    Our tongue grew sweeter in her mouth.

    We chilled beside her liberal glow,
      She dwarfed us by her ampler scale,
      Her full-blown blossom made us pale,
    She summer-like and we like snow.

    We Englishwomen, trim, correct,
      All minted in the self-same mould,
      Warm-hearted but of semblance cold,
    All-courteous out of self-respect.

    She woman in her natural grace,
      Less trammelled she by lore of school,
      Courteous by nature not by rule,
    Warm-hearted and of cordial face.

    So for awhile she made her home
      Among us in the rigid North,
      She who from Italy came forth
    And scaled the Alps and crossed the foam.

    But if she found us like our sea,
      Of aspect colourless and chill,
      Rock-girt; like it she found us still
    Deep at our deepest, strong and free.



    ONCE FOR ALL.

    (Margaret.)


    I said: This is a beautiful fresh rose.
      I said: I will delight me with its scent,
      Will watch its lovely curve of languishment,
    Will watch its leaves unclose, its heart unclose.
    I said: Old Earth has put away her snows,
      All living things make merry to their bent,
      A flower is come for every flower that went
    In autumn; the sun glows, the south wind blows.
    So walking in a garden of delight
      I came upon one sheltered shadowed nook
    Where broad leaf shadows veiled the day with night,
      And there lay snow unmelted by the sun:--
    I answered: Take who will the path I took,
      Winter nips once for all; love is but one.



    AUTUMN VIOLETS.


    Keep love for youth, and violets for the spring:
      Or if these bloom when worn-out autumn grieves,
      Let them lie hid in double shade of leaves,
    Their own, and others dropped down withering;
    For violets suit when home birds build and sing,
      Not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves;
      Not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves,
    But when the green world buds to blossoming.
    Keep violets for the spring, and love for youth,
      Love that should dwell with beauty, mirth, and hope:
        Or if a later sadder love be born,
      Let this not look for grace beyond its scope,
    But give itself, nor plead for answering truth--
        A grateful Ruth tho' gleaning scanty corn.



    "THEY DESIRE A BETTER COUNTRY."


    I.

    I would not if I could undo my past,
      Tho' for its sake my future is a blank;
      My past for which I have myself to thank,
    For all its faults and follies first and last.
    I would not cast anew the lot once cast,
      Or launch a second ship for one that sank,
      Or drug with sweets the bitterness I drank,
    Or break by feasting my perpetual fast.
    I would not if I could: for much more dear
      Is one remembrance than a hundred joys,
        More than a thousand hopes in jubilee;
      Dearer the music of one tearful voice
        That unforgotten calls and calls to me,
    "Follow me here, rise up, and follow here."


    II.

    What seekest thou, far in the unknown land?
      In hope I follow joy gone on before;
      In hope and fear persistent more and more,
    As the dry desert lengthens out its sand.
    Whilst day and night I carry in my hand
      The golden key to ope the golden door
      Of golden home; yet mine eye weepeth sore,
    For long the journey is that makes no stand.
    And who is this that veiled doth walk with thee?
      Lo, this is Love that walketh at my right;
        One exile holds us both, and we are bound
      To selfsame home-joys in the land of light.
    Weeping thou walkest with him; weepeth he?--
        Some sobbing weep, some weep and make no sound.


    III.

    A dimness of a glory glimmers here
      Thro' veils and distance from the space remote,
      A faintest far vibration of a note
    Reaches to us and seems to bring us near;
    Causing our face to glow with braver cheer,
      Making the serried mist to stand afloat,
      Subduing languor with an antidote,
    And strengthening love almost to cast out fear:
    Till for one moment golden city walls
      Rise looming on us, golden walls of home,
    Light of our eyes until the darkness falls;
      Then thro' the outer darkness burdensome
    I hear again the tender voice that calls,
      "Follow me hither, follow, rise, and come."



    A GREEN CORNFIELD.

    "And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest."


    The earth was green, the sky was blue:
      I saw and heard one sunny morn
    A skylark hang between the two,
      A singing speck above the corn;

    A stage below, in gay accord,
      White butterflies danced on the wing,
    And still the singing skylark soared
      And silent sank, and soared to sing.

    The cornfield stretched a tender green
      To right and left beside my walks;
    I knew he had a nest unseen
      Somewhere among the million stalks:

    And as I paused to hear his song
      While swift the sunny moments slid,
    Perhaps his mate sat listening long,
      And listened longer than I did.



    A BRIDE SONG.


    Through the vales to my love!
      To the happy small nest of home
    Green from basement to roof;
      Where the honey-bees come
    To the window-sill flowers,
      And dive from above,
    Safe from the spider that weaves
      Her warp and her woof
    In some outermost leaves.

    Through the vales to my love!
      In sweet April hours
      All rainbows and showers,
    While dove answers dove,--
      In beautiful May,
    When the orchards are tender
      And frothing with flowers,--
      In opulent June,
    When the wheat stands up slender
      By sweet-smelling hay,
    And half the sun's splendour
      Descends to the moon.

    Through the vales to my love!
      Where the turf is so soft to the feet,
      And the thyme makes it sweet,
    And the stately foxglove
      Hangs silent its exquisite bells;
      And where water wells
    The greenness grows greener,
      And bulrushes stand
    Round a lily to screen her.

    Nevertheless, if this land,
      Like a garden to smell and to sight,
    Were turned to a desert of sand,
      Stripped bare of delight,
      All its best gone to worst,
    For my feet no repose,
      No water to comfort my thirst,
    And heaven like a furnace above,--
      The desert would be
      As gushing of waters to me,
    The wilderness be as a rose,
      If it led me to thee,
      O my love!



    THE LOWEST ROOM.


    Like flowers sequestered from the sun
      And wind of summer, day by day
    I dwindled paler, whilst my hair
        Showed the first tinge of grey.

    "Oh, what is life, that we should live?
      Or what is death, that we must die?
    A bursting bubble is our life:
        I also, what am I?"

    "What is your grief? now tell me, sweet,
      That I may grieve," my sister said;
    And stayed a white embroidering hand
        And raised a golden head:

    Her tresses showed a richer mass,
      Her eyes looked softer than my own,
    Her figure had a statelier height,
        Her voice a tenderer tone.

    "Some must be second and not first;
      All cannot be the first of all:
    Is not this, too, but vanity?
      I stumble like to fall.

    "So yesterday I read the acts
      Of Hector and each clangorous king
    With wrathful great Æacides:--
        Old Homer leaves a sting."

    The comely face looked up again,
      The deft hand lingered on the thread
    "Sweet, tell me what is Homer's sting,
        Old Homer's sting?" she said.

    "He stirs my sluggish pulse like wine,
      He melts me like the wind of spice,
    Strong as strong Ajax' red right hand,
        And grand like Juno's eyes.

    "I cannot melt the sons of men,
      I cannot fire and tempest-toss:--
    Besides, those days were golden days,
        Whilst these are days of dross."

    She laughed a feminine low laugh,
      Yet did not stay her dexterous hand:
    "Now tell me of those days," she said,
        "When time ran golden sand."

    "Then men were men of might and right,
      Sheer might, at least, and weighty swords;
    Then men in open blood and fire
        Bore witness to their words,--

    "Crest-rearing kings with whistling spears;
      But if these shivered in the shock
    They wrenched up hundred-rooted trees,
        Or hurled the effacing rock.

    "Then hand to hand, then foot to foot,
      Stern to the death-grip grappling then,
    Who ever thought of gunpowder
        Amongst these men of men?

    "They knew whose hand struck home the death,
      They knew who broke but would not bend,
    Could venerate an equal foe
        And scorn a laggard friend.

    "Calm in the utmost stress of doom,
      Devout toward adverse powers above,
    They hated with intenser hate
        And loved with fuller love.

    "Then heavenly beauty could allay
      As heavenly beauty stirred the strife:
    By them a slave was worshipped more
        Than is by us a wife."

    She laughed again, my sister laughed;
      Made answer o'er the laboured cloth:
    "I rather would be one of us
        Than wife, or slave, or both."

    "Oh better then be slave or wife
      Than fritter now blank life away:
    Then night had holiness of night,
        And day was sacred day.

    "The princess laboured at her loom,
      Mistress and handmaiden alike;
    Beneath their needles grew the field
        With warriors armed to strike.

    "Or, look again, dim Dian's face
      Gleamed perfect through the attendant night:
    Were such not better than those holes
        Amid that waste of white?

    "A shame it is, our aimless life;
      I rather from my heart would feed
    From silver dish in gilded stall
        With wheat and wine the steed--

    "The faithful steed that bore my lord
      In safety through the hostile land,
    The faithful steed that arched his neck
        To fondle with my hand."

    Her needle erred; a moment's pause,
      A moment's patience, all was well.
    Then she: "But just suppose the horse,
        Suppose the rider fell?

    "Then captive in an alien house,
      Hungering on exile's bitter bread,--
    They happy, they who won the lot
        Of sacrifice," she said.

    Speaking she faltered, while her look
      Showed forth her passion like a glass:
    With hand suspended, kindling eye,
        Flushed cheek, how fair she was!

    "Ah well, be those the days of dross;
      This, if you will, the age of gold:
    Yet had those days a spark of warmth,
        While these are somewhat cold--

    "Are somewhat mean and cold and slow,
      Are stunted from heroic growth:
    We gain but little when we prove
        The worthlessness of both."

    "But life is in our hands," she said;
      "In our own hands for gain or loss:
    Shall not the Sevenfold Sacred Fire
        Suffice to purge our dross?

    "Too short a century of dreams,
      One day of work sufficient length:
    Why should not you, why should not I,
        Attain heroic strength?

    "Our life is given us as a blank,
      Ourselves must make it blest or curst:
    Who dooms me I shall only be
        The second, not the first?

    "Learn from old Homer, if you will,
      Such wisdom as his books have said:
    In one the acts of Ajax shine,
        In one of Diomed.

    "Honoured all heroes whose high deeds
      Through life, through death, enlarge their span
    Only Achilles in his rage
        And sloth is less than man."

    "Achilles only less than man?
      He less than man who, half a god,
    Discomfited all Greece with rest,
        Cowed Ilion with a nod?

    "He offered vengeance, lifelong grief
      To one dear ghost, uncounted price:
    Beasts, Trojans, adverse gods, himself,
        Heaped up the sacrifice.

    "Self-immolated to his friend,
      Shrined in world's wonder, Homer's page,
    Is this the man, the less than men
        Of this degenerate age?"

    "Gross from his acorns, tusky boar
      Does memorable acts like his;
    So for her snared offended young
        Bleeds the swart lioness."

    But here she paused; our eyes had met,
      And I was whitening with the jeer;
    She rose: "I went too far," she said;
        Spoke low: "Forgive me, dear.

    "To me our days seem pleasant days,
      Our home a haven of pure content;
    Forgive me if I said too much,
        So much more than I meant.

    "Homer, though greater than his gods,
      With rough-hewn virtues was sufficed
    And rough-hewn men: but what are such
        To us who learn of Christ?"

    The much-moved pathos of her voice,
      Her almost tearful eyes, her cheek
    Grown pale, confessed the strength of love
        Which only made her speak.

    For mild she was, of few soft words,
      Most gentle, easy to be led,
    Content to listen when I spoke,
        And reverence what I said:

    I elder sister by six years;
      Not half so glad, or wise, or good:
    Her words rebuked my secret self
        And shamed me where I stood.

    She never guessed her words reproved
      A silent envy nursed within,
    A selfish, souring discontent
        Pride-born, the devil's sin.

    I smiled, half bitter, half in jest:
      "The wisest man of all the wise
    Left for his summary of life
        'Vanity of vanities.'

    "Beneath the sun there's nothing new:
      Men flow, men ebb, mankind flows on:
    If I am wearied of my life,
        Why, so was Solomon.

    "Vanity of vanities he preached
      Of all he found, of all he sought:
    Vanity of vanities, the gist
        Of all the words he taught.

    "This in the wisdom of the world,
      In Homer's page, in all, we find:
    As the sea is not filled, so yearns
        Man's universal mind.

    "This Homer felt, who gave his men
      With glory but a transient state:
    His very Jove could not reverse
        Irrevocable fate.

    "Uncertain all their lot save this--
      Who wins must lose, who lives must die:
    All trodden out into the dark
        Alike, all vanity."

    She scarcely answered when I paused,
      But rather to herself said: "One
    Is here," low-voiced and loving, "Yea,
        Greater than Solomon."

    So both were silent, she and I:
      She laid her work aside, and went
    Into the garden-walks, like spring,
        All gracious with content:

    A little graver than her wont,
      Because her words had fretted me;
    Not warbling quite her merriest tune
        Bird-like from tree to tree.

    I chose a book to read and dream:
      Yet half the while with furtive eyes
    Marked how she made her choice of flowers
        Intuitively wise,

    And ranged them with instinctive taste
      Which all my books had failed to teach;
    Fresh rose herself, and daintier
        Than blossom of the peach.

    By birthright higher than myself,
      Though nestling of the self-same nest:
    No fault of hers, no fault of mine,
        But stubborn to digest.

    I watched her, till my book unmarked
      Slid noiseless to the velvet floor;
    Till all the opulent summer-world
        Looked poorer than before.

    Just then her busy fingers ceased,
      Her fluttered colour went and came:
    I knew whose step was on the walk,
        Whose voice would name her name.

           * * * * *

    Well, twenty years have passed since then:
      My sister now, a stately wife
    Still fair, looks back in peace and sees
        The longer half of life--

    The longer half of prosperous life,
      With little grief, or fear, or fret:
    She, loved and loving long ago,
        Is loved and loving yet.

    A husband honourable, brave,
      Is her main wealth in all the world:
    And next to him one like herself,
        One daughter golden-curled:

    Fair image of her own fair youth,
      As beautiful and as serene,
    With almost such another love
        As her own love has been.

    Yet, though of world-wide charity,
      And in her home most tender dove,
    Her treasure and her heart are stored
        In the home-land of love.

    She thrives, God's blessed husbandry;
      Most like a vine which full of fruit
    Doth cling and lean and climb toward heaven,
        While earth still binds its root.

    I sit and watch my sister's face:
      How little altered since the hours
    When she, a kind, light-hearted girl,
        Gathered her garden flowers:

    Her song just mellowed by regret
      For having teased me with her talk;
    Then all-forgetful as she heard
        One step upon the walk.

    While I? I sat alone and watched;
      My lot in life, to live alone
    In mine own world of interests,
        Much felt, but little shown.

    Not to be first: how hard to learn
      That lifelong lesson of the past;
    Line graven on line and stroke on stroke:
        But, thank God, learned at last.

    So now in patience I possess
      My soul year after tedious year,
    Content to take the lowest place,
        The place assigned me here.

    Yet sometimes, when I feel my strength
      Most weak, and life most burdensome,
    I lift mine eyes up to the hills
        From whence my help shall come:

    Yea, sometimes still I lift my heart
      To the Archangelic trumpet-burst,
    When all deep secrets shall be shown,
        And many last be first.



    DEAD HOPE.


    Hope new born one pleasant morn
      Died at even;
    Hope dead lives nevermore,
      No, not in heaven.

    If his shroud were but a cloud
      To weep itself away;
    Or were he buried underground
      To sprout some day!
    But dead and gone is dead and gone
      Vainly wept upon.

    Nought we place above his face
      To mark the spot,
    But it shows a barren place
      In our lot.



    A DAUGHTER OF EVE.


    A fool I was to sleep at noon,
      And wake when night is chilly
    Beneath the comfortless cold moon;
    A fool to pluck my rose too soon,
      A fool to snap my lily.

    My garden-plot I have not kept;
      Faded and all-forsaken,
    I weep as I have never wept:
    Oh it was summer when I slept,
      It's winter now I waken.

    Talk what you please of future spring
      And sun-warmed sweet to-morrow:--
    Stripped bare of hope and every thing,
    No more to laugh, no more to sing,
      I sit alone with sorrow.



    VENUS' LOOKING-GLASS.


    I marked where lovely Venus and her court
      With song and dance and merry laugh went by;
      Weightless, their wingless feet seemed made to fly,
    Bound from the ground and in mid air to sport.
    Left far behind I heard the dolphins snort,
      Tracking their goddess with a wistful eye,
      Around whose head white doves rose, wheeling high
    Or low, and cooed after their tender sort.
    All this I saw in spring. Through summer heat
      I saw the lovely Queen of Love no more.
      But when flushed autumn through the woodlands went
    I spied sweet Venus walk amid the wheat:
      Whom seeing, every harvester gave o'er
      His toil, and laughed and hoped and was content.



    LOVE LIES BLEEDING.


    Love that is dead and buried, yesterday
      Out of his grave rose up before my face,
      No recognition in his look, no trace
    Of memory in his eyes dust-dimmed and grey.
    While I, remembering, found no word to say,
      But felt my quickened heart leap in its place;
      Caught afterglow thrown back from long set days,
    Caught echoes of all music passed away.
    Was this indeed to meet?--I mind me yet
      In youth we met when hope and love were quick,
        We parted with hope dead, but love alive:
      I mind me how we parted then heart sick,
        Remembering, loving, hopeless, weak to strive:--
    Was this to meet? Not so, we have not met.



    BIRD RAPTURES.


    The sunrise wakes the lark to sing,
      The moonrise wakes the nightingale.
    Come darkness, moonrise, every thing
      That is so silent, sweet, and pale:
      Come, so ye wake the nightingale.

    Make haste to mount, thou wistful moon,
      Make haste to wake the nightingale:
    Let silence set the world in tune
    To hearken to that wordless tale
    Which warbles from the nightingale

    O herald skylark, stay thy flight
      One moment, for a nightingale
    Floods us with sorrow and delight.
      To-morrow thou shalt hoist the sail;
      Leave us to-night the nightingale.



    MY FRIEND.


    Two days ago with dancing glancing hair,
      With living lips and eyes:
      Now pale, dumb, blind, she lies;
    So pale, yet still so fair.

    We have not left her yet, not yet alone;
      But soon must leave her where
      She will not miss our care,
    Bone of our bone.

    Weep not; O friends, we should not weep:
      Our friend of friends lies full of rest;
      No sorrow rankles in her breast,
    Fallen fast asleep.

    She sleeps below,
      She wakes and laughs above;
      To-day, as she walked, let us walk in love,
    To-morrow follow so.



    TWILIGHT NIGHT.


    I.

    We met, hand to hand,
      We clasped hands close and fast,
    As close as oak and ivy stand;
      But it is past:
      Come day, come night, day comes at last.

    We loosed hand from hand,
      We parted face from face;
    Each went his way to his own land
      At his own pace:
      Each went to fill his separate place.

    If we should meet one day,
      If both should not forget.
    We shall clasp hands the accustomed way,
      As when we met
      So long ago, as I remember yet.

    II.

    Where my heart is (wherever that may be)
      Might I but follow!
    If you fly thither over heath and lea,
    O honey-seeking bee,
      O careless swallow!
    Bid some for whom I watch keep watch for me

    Alas! that we must dwell, my heart and I,
      So far asunder.
    Hours wax to days, and days and days creep by;
    I watch with wistful eye,
      I wait and wonder:
    When will that day draw nigh--that hour draw nigh?

    Not yesterday, and not I think to-day;
      Perhaps to-morrow.
    Day after day "to-morrow," thus I say:
    I watched so yesterday
      In hope and sorrow,
    Again to-day I watch the accustomed way.



    A BIRD SONG.


    It's a year almost that I have not seen her:
    Oh, last summer green things were greener,
    Brambles fewer, the blue sky bluer.

    It's surely summer, for there's a swallow:
    Come one swallow, his mate will follow,
    The bird race quicken and wheel and thicken.

    Oh happy swallow whose mate will follow
    O'er height, o'er hollow! I'd be a swallow,
    To build this weather one nest together.



    A SMILE AND A SIGH.


    A smile because the nights are short!
      And every morning brings such pleasure
    Of sweet love-making, harmless sport:
      Love that makes and finds its treasure;
      Love, treasure without measure.

    A sigh because the days are long!
      Long, long these days that pass in sighing,
    A burden saddens every song:
      While time lags which should be flying,
      We live who would be dying.




DEVOTIONAL PIECES.




    AMOR MUNDI.


    "O where are you going with your love-locks flowing,
      On the west wind blowing along this valley track?"
    "The downhill path is easy, come with me an it please ye,
      We shall escape the uphill by never turning back."

    So they two went together in glowing August weather,
      The honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right;
    And dear she was to doat on, her swift feet seemed to float on
      The air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight.

    "Oh, what is that in heaven where grey cloud-flakes are seven,
      Where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt?"
    "Oh, that's a meteor sent us, a message dumb, portentous,
      An undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt."

    "Oh, what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly,
      Their scent comes rich and sickly?"--"A scaled and hooded worm."
    "Oh, what's that in the hollow, so pale I quake to follow?"
      "Oh, that's a thin dead body which waits the eternal term."

    "Turn again, O my sweetest,--turn again, false and fleetest:
      This beaten way thou beatest I fear is hell's own track."
    "Nay, too steep for hill mounting; nay, too late for cost counting:
      This downhill path is easy, but there's no turning back."



    A CHRISTMAS CAROL.


    In the bleak mid-winter
      Frosty wind made moan,
    Earth stood hard as iron,
      Water like a stone;
    Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
      Snow on snow,
    In the bleak mid-winter
      Long ago.

    Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him
      Nor earth sustain;
    Heaven and earth shall flee away
      When He comes to reign:
    In the bleak mid-winter
      A stable-place sufficed
    The Lord God Almighty
      Jesus Christ.

    Enough for Him whom cherubim
      Worship night and day,
    A breastful of milk
      And a mangerful of hay;
    Enough for Him whom angels
      Fall down before,
    The ox and ass and camel
      Which adore.

    Angels and archangels
      May have gathered there,
    Cherubim and seraphim
      Throng'd the air,
    But only His mother
      In her maiden bliss
    Worshipped her Beloved
      With a kiss.

    What can I give Him,
      Poor as I am?
    If I were a shepherd
      I would bring a lamb,
    If I were a wise man
      I would do my part,--
    Yet what I can I give Him,
      Give my heart.



    BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON.

    B.C. 570.


    Here, where I dwell, I waste to skin and bone;
      The curse is come upon me, and I waste
      In penal torment powerless to atone.
    The curse is come on me, which makes no haste
      And doth not tarry, crushing both the proud
      Hard man and him the sinner double-faced.
    Look not upon me, for my soul is bowed
      Within me, as my body in this mire;
      My soul crawls dumb-struck, sore bestead and cowed
    As Sodom and Gomorrah scourged by fire,
      As Jericho before God's trumpet-peal,
      So we the elect ones perish in His ire.
    Vainly we gird on sackcloth, vainly kneel
      With famished faces toward Jerusalem:
      His heart is shut against us not to feel,
    His ears against our cry He shutteth them,
      His hand He shorteneth that He will not save,
      His law is loud against us to condemn:
    And we, as unclean bodies in the grave
      Inheriting corruption and the dark,
      Are outcast from His presence which we crave.
    Our Mercy hath departed from His Ark,
      Our Glory hath departed from His rest,
      Our Shield hath left us naked as a mark
    Unto all pitiless eyes made manifest.
      Our very Father hath forsaken us,
      Our God hath cast us from Him: we oppress'd
    Unto our foes are even marvellous,
      A hissing and a butt for pointing hands,
      Whilst God Almighty hunts and grinds us thus;
    For He hath scattered us in alien lands,
      Our priests, our princes, our anointed king,
      And bound us hand and foot with brazen bands.
    Here while I sit, my painful heart takes wing
      Home to the home-land I may see no more,
      Where milk and honey flow, where waters spring
    And fail not, where I dwelt in days of yore
      Under my fig-tree and my fruitful vine,
      There where my parents dwelt at ease before:
    Now strangers press the olives that are mine,
      Reap all the corners of my harvest-field,
      And make their fat hearts wanton with my wine;
    To them my trees, to them my gardens yield
      Their sweets and spices and their tender green,
      O'er them in noontide heat outspread their shield.
    Yet these are they whose fathers had not been
      Housed with my dogs; whom hip and thigh we smote
      And with their blood washed their pollutions clean,
    Purging the land which spewed them from its throat;
      Their daughters took we for a pleasant prey,
      Choice tender ones on whom the fathers dote:
    Now they in turn have led our own away;
      Our daughters and our sisters and our wives
      Sore weeping as they weep who curse the day,
    To live, remote from help, dishonoured lives,
      Soothing their drunken masters with a song,
      Or dancing in their golden tinkling gyves--
    Accurst if they remember through the long
      Estrangement of their exile, twice accursed
      If they forget and join the accursèd throng.
    How doth my heart that is so wrung not burst
      When I remember that my way was plain,
      And that God's candle lit me at the first,
    Whilst now I grope in darkness, grope in vain,
      Desiring but to find Him Who is lost,
      To find him once again, but once again!
    His wrath came on us to the uttermost,
      His covenanted and most righteous wrath.
      Yet this is He of Whom we made our boast,
    Who lit the Fiery Pillar in our path,
      Who swept the Red Sea dry before our feet,
      Who in His jealousy smote kings, and hath
    Sworn once to David: One shall fill thy seat
      Born of thy body, as the sun and moon
      'Stablished for aye in sovereignty complete.
    O Lord, remember David, and that soon.
      The Glory hath departed, Ichabod!
      Yet now, before our sun grow dark at noon,
    Before we come to nought beneath Thy rod,
      Before we go down quick into the pit,
      Remember us for good, O God, our God:--
    Thy Name will I remember, praising it,
      Though Thou forget me, though Thou hide Thy face,
      And blot me from the Book which Thou hast writ;
    Thy Name will I remember in my praise
      And call to mind Thy faithfulness of old,
    Though as a weaver Thou cut off my days
      And end me as a tale ends that is told.



    PARADISE.


    Once in a dream I saw the flowers
      That bud and bloom in Paradise;
      More fair they are than waking eyes
    Have seen in all this world of ours.
    And faint the perfume-bearing rose,
      And faint the lily on its stem,
    And faint the perfect violet
        Compared with them.

    I heard the songs of Paradise:
      Each bird sat singing in his place;
      A tender song so full of grace
    It soared like incense to the skies.
    Each bird sat singing to his mate
      Soft-cooing notes among the trees:
    The nightingale herself were cold
        To such as these.

    I saw the fourfold River flow,
      And deep it was, with golden sand;
      It flowed between a mossy land
    With murmured music grave and low.
    It hath refreshment for all thirst,
      For fainting spirits strength and rest;
    Earth holds not such a draught as this
        From east to west.

    The Tree of Life stood budding there,
      Abundant with its twelvefold fruits;
      Eternal sap sustains its roots,
    Its shadowing branches fill the air.
    Its leaves are healing for the world,
      Its fruit the hungry world can feed,
    Sweeter than honey to the taste,
        And balm indeed.

    I saw the gate called Beautiful;
      And looked, but scarce could look within;
      I saw the golden streets begin,
    And outskirts of the glassy pool.
    Oh harps, oh crowns of plenteous stars,
      O green palm branches many-leaved--
    Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,
        Nor heart conceived!

    I hope to see these things again,
      But not as once in dreams by night;
      To see them with my very sight,
    And touch and handle and attain:
    To have all Heaven beneath my feet
      For narrow way that once they trod;
    To have my part with all the saints,
        And with my God.



    "I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO THE HILLS."


    I am pale with sick desire,
      For my heart is far away
    From this world's fitful fire
      And this world's waning day;
    In a dream it overleaps
      A world of tedious ills
    To where the sunshine sleeps
      On the everlasting hills.--
      Say the Saints: There Angels ease us
        Glorified and white.
      They say: We rest in Jesus,
        Where is not day or night.

    My soul saith: I have sought
      For a home that is not gained,
    I have spent yet nothing bought,
      Have laboured but not attained;
    My pride strove to mount and grow,
      And hath but dwindled down;
    My love sought love, and lo!
      Hath not attained its crown.--
      Say the Saints: Fresh souls increase us,
        None languish or recede.
      They say: We love our Jesus,
        And He loves us indeed.

    I cannot rise above,
      I cannot rest beneath,
    I cannot find out love,
      Or escape from death;
    Dear hopes and joys gone by
      Still mock me with a name;
    My best belovèd die,
      And I cannot die with them.--
      Say the Saints: No deaths decrease us,
        Where our rest is glorious.
      They say: We live in Jesus,
        Who once died for us.

    O my soul, she beats her wings
      And pants to fly away
    Up to immortal things
      In the heavenly day:
    Yet she flags and almost faints;
      Can such be meant for me?--
    Come and see, say the Saints.
      Saith Jesus: Come and see.
      Say the Saints: His pleasures please us
        Before God and the Lamb.
      Come and taste My sweets, saith Jesus:
        Be with Me where I am.



    SAINTS AND ANGELS.


    It's oh in Paradise that I fain would be,
      Away from earth and weariness and all beside;
    Earth is too full of loss with its dividing sea,
      But Paradise upbuilds the bower for the bride.

    Where flowers are yet in bud while the boughs are green,
      I would get quit of earth and get robed for heaven;
    Putting on my raiment white within the screen,
      Putting on my crown of gold whose gems are seven

    Fair is the fourfold river that maketh no moan,
      Fair are the trees fruit-bearing of the wood,
    Fair are the gold and bdellium and the onyx stone,
      And I know the gold of that land is good.

    O my love, my dove, lift up your eyes
      Toward the eastern gate like an opening rose;
    You and I who parted will meet in Paradise,
      Pass within and sing when the gates unclose.

    This life is but the passage of a day,
      This life is but a pang and all is over;
    But in the life to come which fades not away
      Every love shall abide and every lover.

    He who wore out pleasure and mastered all lore,
      Solomon, wrote "Vanity of vanities:"
    Down to death, of all that went before
      In his mighty long life, the record is this.

    With loves by the hundred, wealth beyond measure,
      Is this he who wrote "Vanity of vanities"?
    Yea, "Vanity of vanities" he saith of pleasure,
      And of all he learned set his seal to this.

    Yet we love and faint not, for our love is one,
      And we hope and flag not, for our hope is sure,
    Although there be nothing new beneath the sun
      And no help for life and for death no cure.

    The road to death is life, the gate of life is death,
      We who wake shall sleep, we shall wax who wane;
    Let us not vex our souls for stoppage of a breath,
      The fall of a river that turneth not again.

    Be the road short, and be the gate near,--
      Shall a short road tire, a strait gate appall?
    The loves that meet in Paradise shall cast out fear,
      And Paradise hath room for you and me and all.



    "WHEN MY HEART IS VEXED, I WILL COMPLAIN."


    "O Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me?
      Me whom thou settest in a barren land,
      Hungry and thirsty on the burning sand,
    Hungry and thirsty where no waters be
    Nor shadows of date-bearing tree:--
    O Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me?"

    "I came from Edom by as parched a track,
      As rough a track beneath My bleeding feet.
      I came from Edom seeking thee, and sweet
    I counted bitterness; I turned not back
    But counted life as death, and trod
    The winepress all alone: and I am God."

    "Yet, Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me?
      For Thou art strong to comfort: and could I
      But comfort one I love, who, like to die,
    Lifts feeble hands and eyes that fail to see
    In one last prayer for comfort--nay,
    I could not stand aside or turn away."

    "Alas! thou knowest that for thee I died
      For thee I thirsted with the dying thirst;
      I, Blessed, for thy sake was counted cursed,
    In sight of men and angels crucified:
    All this and more I bore to prove
    My love, and wilt thou yet mistrust My love?"

    "Lord, I am fain to think Thou lovest me,
      For Thou art all in all and I am Thine;
      And lo! Thy love is better than new wine,
    And I am sick of love in loving Thee.
    But dost Thou love me? speak and save,
    For jealousy is cruel as the grave."

    "Nay, if thy love is not an empty breath
      My love is as thine own--deep answers deep.
      Peace, peace: I give to my beloved sleep,
    Not death but sleep, for love is strong as death:
    Take patience; sweet thy sleep shall be,
    Yea, thou shalt wake in Paradise with Me."



    AFTER COMMUNION.


    Why should I call Thee Lord, Who art my God?
      Why should I call Thee Friend, Who art my Love?
      Or King, Who art my very Spouse above?
    Or call Thy Sceptre on my heart Thy rod?
      Lo, now Thy banner over me is love,
    All heaven flies open to me at Thy nod:
    For Thou hast lit Thy flame in me a clod,
      Made me a nest for dwelling of Thy Dove.
      What wilt Thou call me in our home above,
    Who now hast called me friend? how will it be
        When Thou for good wine settest forth the best?
    Now Thou dost bid me come and sup with Thee,
        Now Thou dost make me lean upon Thy breast:
    How will it be with me in time of love?



    A ROSE PLANT IN JERICHO.


    At morn I plucked a rose and gave it Thee,
      A rose of joy and happy love and peace,
        A rose with scarce a thorn:
        But in the chillness of a second morn
      My rose bush drooped, and all its gay increase
    Was but one thorn that wounded me.

    I plucked the thorn and offered it to Thee;
      And for my thorn Thou gavest love and peace,
        Not joy this mortal morn:
        If Thou hast given much treasure for a thorn,
      Wilt thou not give me for my rose increase
    Of gladness, and all sweets to me?

    My thorny rose, my love and pain, to Thee
      I offer; and I set my heart in peace,
        And rest upon my thorn:
        For verily I think to-morrow morn
      Shall bring me Paradise, my gift's increase,
    Yea, give Thy very Self to me.



    WHO SHALL DELIVER ME?


    God strengthen me to bear myself;
    That heaviest weight of all to bear,
    Inalienable weight of care.

    All others are outside myself;
    I lock my door and bar them out,
    The turmoil, tedium, gad-about.

    I lock my door upon myself,
    And bar them out; but who shall wall
    Self from myself, most loathed of all?

    If I could once lay down myself,
    And start self-purged upon the race
    That all must run! Death runs apace.

    If I could set aside myself,
    And start with lightened heart upon
    The road by all men overgone!

    God harden me against myself,
    This coward with pathetic voice
    Who craves for ease and rest and joys:

    Myself, arch-traitor to myself;
    My hollowest friend, my deadliest foe,
    My clog whatever road I go.

    Yet One there is can curb myself,
    Can roll the strangling load from me.
    Break off the yoke and set me free.




DEVOTIONAL PIECES.




    DESPISED AND REJECTED.


    My sun has set, I dwell
    In darkness as a dead man out of sight;
    And none remains, not one, that I should tell
    To him mine evil plight
    This bitter night.
    I will make fast my door
    That hollow friends may trouble me no more.

    "Friend, open to Me."--Who is this that calls?
    Nay, I am deaf as are my walls:
    Cease crying, for I will not hear
    Thy cry of hope or fear.
    Others were dear,
    Others forsook me: what art thou indeed
    That I should heed
    Thy lamentable need?
    Hungry should feed,
    Or stranger lodge thee here?

    "Friend, My Feet bleed.
    Open thy door to Me and comfort Me."
    I will not open, trouble me no more.
    Go on thy way footsore,
    I will not rise and open unto thee.

    "Then is it nothing to thee? Open, see
    Who stands to plead with thee.
    Open, lest I should pass thee by, and thou
    One day entreat My Face
    And howl for grace,
    And I be deaf as thou art now.
    Open to Me."

    Then I cried out upon him: Cease,
    Leave me in peace:
    Fear not that I should crave
    Aught thou mayst have.
    Leave me in peace, yea trouble me no more,
    Lest I arise and chase thee from my door.
    What, shall I not be let
    Alone, that thou dost vex me yet?

    But all night long that voice spake urgently:
    "Open to Me."
    Still harping in mine ears:
    "Rise, let Me in."
    Pleading with tears:
    "Open to Me that I may come to thee."
    While the dew dropped, while the dark hours were cold:
    "My Feet bleed, see My Face,
    See My Hands bleed that bring thee grace,
    My Heart doth bleed for thee,
    Open to Me."

    So till the break of day:
    Then died away
    That voice, in silence as of sorrow;
    Then footsteps echoing like a sigh
    Passed me by,
    Lingering footsteps slow to pass.
    On the morrow
    I saw upon the grass
    Each footprint marked in blood, and on my door
    The mark of blood forevermore.



    LONG BARREN.


    Thou who didst hang upon a barren tree,
    My God, for me;
      Though I till now be barren, now at length,
      Lord, give me strength
    To bring forth fruit to Thee.

    Thou who didst bear for me the crown of thorn,
    Spitting and scorn;
      Though I till now have put forth thorns, yet now
      Strengthen me Thou
    That better fruit be borne.

    Thou Rose of Sharon, Cedar of broad roots,
    Vine of sweet fruits,
      Thou Lily of the vale with fadeless leaf,
      Of thousands Chief,
    Feed Thou my feeble shoots.



    IF ONLY.


    If I might only love my God and die!
    But now He bids me love Him and live on,
      Now when the bloom of all my life is gone,
    The pleasant half of life has quite gone by.
    My tree of hope is lopped that spread so high,
      And I forget how summer glowed and shone,
      While autumn grips me with its fingers wan,
    And frets me with its fitful windy sigh.
    When autumn passes then must winter numb,
      And winter may not pass a weary while,
        But when it passes spring shall flower again:
      And in that spring who weepeth now shall smile,
        Yea, they shall wax who now are on the wane,
    Yea, they shall sing for love when Christ shall come.



    DOST THOU NOT CARE?


    I love and love not: Lord, it breaks my heart
      To love and not to love.
    Thou veiled within Thy glory, gone apart
      Into Thy shrine, which is above,
    Dost Thou not love me, Lord, or care
      For this mine ill?--
    _I love thee here or there,_
      _I will accept thy broken heart, lie still._

    Lord, it was well with me in time gone by
      That cometh not again,
    When I was fresh and cheerful, who but I?
      I fresh, I cheerful: worn with pain
    Now, out of sight and out of heart;
      O Lord, how long?--
    _I watch thee as thou art,_
      _I will accept thy fainting heart, be strong._

    "Lie still," "be strong," to-day; but, Lord, to-morrow,
      What of to-morrow, Lord?
    Shall there be rest from toil, be truce from sorrow,
      Be living green upon the sward
    Now but a barren grave to me,
      Be joy for sorrow?--
    _Did I not die for thee?_
      _Do I not live for thee? leave Me to-morrow._



    WEARY IN WELL-DOING.


    I would have gone; God bade me stay:
      I would have worked; God bade me rest.
    He broke my will from day to day,
      He read my yearnings unexpressed,
        And said them nay.

    Now I would stay; God bids me go:
      Now I would rest; God bids me work.
    He breaks my heart tossed to and fro,
      My soul is wrung with doubts that lurk
        And vex it so.

    I go, Lord, where Thou sendest me;
      Day after day I plod and moil:
    But, Christ my God, when will it be
      That I may let alone my toil
        And rest with Thee?



    MARTYRS' SONG.


    We meet in joy, though we part in sorrow;
    We part to-night, but we meet to-morrow.
    Be it flood or blood the path that's trod,
    All the same it leads home to God:
    Be it furnace-fire voluminous,
    One like God's Son will walk with us.

    What are these that glow from afar,
    These that lean over the golden bar,
    Strong as the lion, pure as the dove,
    With open arms and hearts of love?
    They the blessed ones gone before,
    They the blessed forevermore.
    Out of great tribulation they went
    Home to their home of Heaven-content;
    Through flood, or blood, or furnace-fire,
    To the rest that fulfils desire.

    What are these that fly as a cloud,
    With flashing heads and faces bowed,
    In their mouths a victorious psalm,
    In their hands a robe and a palm?
    Welcoming angels these that shine,
    Your own angel, and yours, and mine;
    Who have hedged us both day and night
    On the left hand and on the right,
    Who have watched us both night and day
    Because the Devil keeps watch to slay.

    Light above light, and Bliss beyond bliss,
    Whom words cannot utter, lo, Who is This?
    As a King with many crowns He stands,
    And our names are graven upon His hands;
    As a Priest, with God-uplifted eyes,
    He offers for us His Sacrifice;
    As the Lamb of God for sinners slain,
    That we too may live He lives again;
    As our Champion behold Him stand,
    Strong to save us, at God's Right Hand.

    God the Father give us grace
    To walk in the light of Jesus' Face.
    God the Son give us a part
    In the hiding-place of Jesus' Heart:
    God the Spirit so hold us up
    That we may drink of Jesus' cup.

    Death is short and life is long;
    Satan is strong, but Christ more strong.
    At His Word, Who hath led us hither,
    The Red Sea must part hither and thither.
    At His Word, Who goes before us too,
    Jordan must cleave to let us through.

    Yet one pang, searching and sore,
    And then Heaven forevermore;
    Yet one moment awful and dark,
    Then safety within the Veil and the Ark;
    Yet one effort by Christ His grace,
    Then Christ forever face to face.

    God the Father we will adore,
    In Jesus' Name, now and evermore:
    God the Son we will love and thank
    In this flood and on the farther bank:
    God the Holy Ghost we will praise,
    In Jesus' Name, through endless days:
    God Almighty, God Three in One,
    God Almighty, God alone.



    AFTER THIS THE JUDGMENT.


    As eager home-bound traveller to the goal,
      Or steadfast seeker on an unsearched main,
    Or martyr panting for an aureole,
      My fellow-pilgrims pass me, and attain
    That hidden mansion of perpetual peace,
      Where keen desire and hope dwell free from pain:
    That gate stands open of perennial ease;
      I view the glory till I partly long,
    Yet lack the fire of love which quickens these.
      O, passing Angel, speed me with a song,
    A melody of heaven to reach my heart
      And rouse me to the race and make me strong;
    Till in such music I take up my part,
      Swelling those Hallelujahs full of rest,
    One, tenfold, hundred-fold, with heavenly art,
      Fulfilling north and south and east and west,
    Thousand, ten-thousand-fold, innumerable,
      All blent in one yet each one manifest;
    Each one distinguished and beloved as well
      As if no second voice in earth or heaven
    Were lifted up the Love of God to tell.
      Ah, Love of God, which Thine Own Self hast given
    To me most poor, and made me rich in love,
      Love that dost pass the tenfold seven times seven.
    Draw Thou mine eyes, draw Thou my heart above,
      My treasure and my heart store Thou in Thee,
    Brood over me with yearnings of a dove;
      Be Husband, Brother, closest Friend to me;
    Love me as very mother loves her son,
      Her sucking firstborn fondled on her knee:
    Yea, more than mother loves her little one;
      For, earthly, even a mother may forget
    And feel no pity for its piteous moan;
      But Thou, O Love of God, remember yet,
    Through the dry desert, through the waterflood
      (Life, death), until the Great White Throne is set.
    If now I am sick in chewing the bitter cud
      Of sweet past sin, though solaced by Thy grace,
    And ofttimes strengthened by Thy Flesh and Blood,
      How shall I then stand up before Thy face,
    When from Thine eyes repentance shall be hid,
      And utmost Justice stand in Mercy's place:
    When every sin I thought or spoke or did
      Shall meet me at the inexorable bar,
    And there be no man standing in the mid
      To plead for me; while star fallen after star
    With heaven and earth are like a ripened shock,
      And all time's mighty works and wonders are
    Consumed as in a moment; when no rock
      Remains to fall on me, no tree to hide,
    But I stand all creation's gazing-stock,
      Exposed and comfortless on every side,
    Placed trembling in the final balances
      Whose poise this hour, this moment, must be tried?--
    Ah, Love of God, if greater love than this
      Hath no man, that a man die for his friend,
    And if such love of love Thine Own Love is,
      Plead with Thyself, with me, before the end;
    Redeem me from the irrevocable past;
      Pitch Thou Thy Presence round me to defend;
    Yea seek with piercèd feet, yea hold me fast
      With piercèd hands whose wounds were made by love;
    Not what I am, remember what Thou wast
      When darkness hid from Thee Thy heavens above,
    And sin Thy Father's Face, while Thou didst drink
      The bitter cup of death, didst taste thereof
    For every man; while Thou wast nigh to sink
      Beneath the intense intolerable rod,
    Grown sick of love; not what I am, but think
      Thy Life then ransomed mine, my God, my God.



    GOOD FRIDAY.


    Am I a stone and not a sheep
      That I can stand, O Christ, beneath Thy Cross,
      To number drop by drop Thy Blood's slow loss,
    And yet not weep?

    Not so those women loved
      Who with exceeding grief lamented Thee;
      Not so fallen Peter weeping bitterly;
    Not so the thief was moved;

    Not so the Sun and Moon
      Which hid their faces in a starless sky,
      A horror of great darkness at broad noon,--
    I, only I.

    Yet give not o'er,
      But seek Thy sheep, true Shepherd of the flock;
    Greater than Moses, turn and look once more
      And smite a rock.



    THE LOWEST PLACE.


    Give me the lowest place: not that I dare
      Ask for that lowest place, but Thou hast died
    That I might live and share
      Thy glory by Thy side.

    Give me the lowest place: or if for me
      That lowest place too high, make one more low
    Where I may sit and see
      My God and love Thee so.



A PAGEANT AND OTHER POEMS.


    Sonnets are full of love, and this my tome
      Has many sonnets: so here now shall be
      One sonnet more, a love sonnet, from me
    To her whose heart is my heart's quiet home,
      To my first Love, my Mother, on whose knee
    I learnt love-lore that is not troublesome;
      Whose service is my special dignity,
    And she my loadstar while I go and come.
    And so because you love me, and because
      I love you, Mother, I have woven a wreath
        Of rhymes wherewith to crown your honored name:
        In you not fourscore years can dim the flame
    Of love, whose blessed glow transcends the laws
      Of time and change and mortal life and death.



    THE KEY-NOTE.


    Where are the songs I used to know,
      Where are the notes I used to sing?
      I have forgotten everything
    I used to know so long ago;
    Summer has followed after Spring;
      Now Autumn is so shrunk and sere,
    I scarcely think a sadder thing
      Can be the Winter of my year.

    Yet Robin sings through Winter's rest,
      When bushes put their berries on;
      While they their ruddy jewels don,
    He sings out of a ruddy breast;
    The hips and haws and ruddy breast
      Make one spot warm where snowflakes lie
    They break and cheer the unlovely rest
      Of Winter's pause--and why not I?

      _Scene_: A Cottage with its Grounds.


    [A room in a large comfortable cottage; a fire burning on
    the hearth; a table on which the breakfast things have
    been left standing. January discovered seated by the
    fire.]


              _January._

    Cold the day and cold the drifted snow,
    Dim the day until the cold dark night.

                        [Stirs the fire.

    Crackle, sparkle, fagot; embers glow:
    Some one may be plodding through the snow
    Longing for a light,
    For the light that you and I can show.
    If no one else should come,
    Here Robin Redbreast's welcome to a crumb,
    And never troublesome:
    Robin, why don't you come and fetch your crumb?


      Here's butter for my hunch of bread,
        And sugar for your crumb;
      Here's room upon the hearthrug,
        If you'll only come.

      In your scarlet waistcoat,
        With your keen bright eye,
      Where are you loitering?
        Wings were made to fly!

      Make haste to breakfast,
        Come and fetch your crumb,
      For I'm as glad to see you
        As you are glad to come.


    [Two Robin Redbreasts are seen tapping with their beaks at
    the lattice, which January opens. The birds flutter in,
    hop about the floor, and peck up the crumbs and sugar
    thrown to them. They have scarcely finished their meal,
    when a knock is heard at the door. January hangs a
    guard in front of the fire, and opens to February, who
    appears with a bunch of snowdrops in her hand.]

              _January._

    Good-morrow, sister.

              _February._

                Brother, joy to you!
    I've brought some snowdrops; only just a few,
    But quite enough to prove the world awake,
    Cheerful and hopeful in the frosty dew
    And for the pale sun's sake.

    [She hands a few of her snowdrops to January, who retires
    into the background. While February stands arranging
    the remaining snowdrops in a glass of water on the
    window-sill, a soft butting and bleating are heard outside.
    She opens the door, and sees one foremost lamb, with
    other sheep and lambs bleating and crowding towards
    her.]

              _February._

    O you, you little wonder, come--come in,
    You wonderful, you woolly soft white lamb:
    You panting mother ewe, come too,
    And lead that tottering twin
    Safe in:
    Bring all your bleating kith and kin,
    Except the horny ram.

    [February opens a second door in the background, and the
    little flock files through into a warm and sheltered compartment
    out of sight.]

      The lambkin tottering in its walk
        With just a fleece to wear;
      The snowdrop drooping on its stalk
          So slender,--
      Snowdrop and lamb, a pretty pair,
      Braving the cold for our delight,
          Both white,
          Both tender.

    [A rattling of doors and windows; branches seen without,
    tossing violently to and fro.]

    How the doors rattle, and the branches sway!
    Here's brother March comes whirling on his way
    With winds that eddy and sing.

    [She turns the handle of the door, which bursts open, and
    discloses March hastening up, both hands full of violets
    and anemones.]

              _February._

    Come, show me what you bring;
    For I have said my say, fulfilled my day,
    And must away.

              _March._

    [Stopping short on the threshold.]

        I blow an arouse
        Through the world's wide house
      To quicken the torpid earth:
        Grappling I fling
        Each feeble thing,
      But bring strong life to the birth.
        I wrestle and frown,
        And topple down;
      I wrench, I rend, I uproot;
        Yet the violet
        Is born where I set
      The sole of my flying foot,

    [Hands violets and anemones to February, who retires into
    the background.]

        And in my wake
        Frail wind-flowers quake,
      And the catkins promise fruit.
        I drive ocean ashore
        With rush and roar,
      And he cannot say me nay:
        My harpstrings all
        Are the forests tall,
      Making music when I play.
        And as others perforce,
        So I on my course
      Run and needs must run,
        With sap on the mount
        And buds past count
      And rivers and clouds and sun,
        With seasons and breath
        And time and death
      And all that has yet begun.

    [Before March has done speaking, a voice is heard approaching
    accompanied by a twittering of birds. April comes
    along singing, and stands outside and out of sight to finish
    her song.]

              _April._

    [Outside.]

      Pretty little three
      Sparrows in a tree,
        Light upon the wing;
        Though you cannot sing
        You can chirp of Spring:
      Chirp of Spring to me,
      Sparrows, from your tree.

      Never mind the showers,
      Chirp about the flowers
        While you build a nest:
        Straws from east and west,
        Feathers from your breast,
      Make the snuggest bowers
      In a world of flowers.

      You must dart away
      From the chosen spray,
        You intrusive third
        Extra little bird;
        Join the unwedded herd!
      These have done with play,
      And must work to-day.

              _April._

    [Appearing at the open door.]

    Good-morrow and good-bye: if others fly,
    Of all the flying months you're the most flying.

              _March._

    You're hope and sweetness, April.

              _April._

                Birth means dying,
    As wings and wind mean flying;
    So you and I and all things fly or die;
    And sometimes I sit sighing to think of dying.
    But meanwhile I've a rainbow in my showers,
    And a lapful of flowers,
    And these dear nestlings aged three hours;
    And here's their mother sitting,
    Their father's merely flitting
    To find their breakfast somewhere in my bowers.

    [As she speaks April shows March her apron full of flowers
    and nest full of birds. March wanders away into the
    grounds. April, without entering the cottage, hangs over
    the hungry nestlings watching them.]

              _April._

      What beaks you have, you funny things,
        What voices shrill and weak;
      Who'd think that anything that sings
        Could sing through such a beak?
      Yet you'll be nightingales one day,
        And charm the country-side,
      When I'm away and far away
        And May is queen and bride.

    [May arrives unperceived by April, and gives her a kiss.
    April starts and looks round.]

              _April._

    Ah May, good-morrow May, and so good-bye.

              _May._

    That's just your way, sweet April, smile and sigh:
    Your sorrow's half in fun,
    Begun and done
    And turned to joy while twenty seconds run.
    I've gathered flowers all as I came along,
    At every step a flower
    Fed by your last bright shower,--

    [She divides an armful of all sorts of flowers with April, who
    strolls away through the garden.]

              _May._

    And gathering flowers I listened to the song
    Of every bird in bower.
        The world and I are far too full of bliss
        To think or plan or toil or care;
          The sun is waxing strong,
          The days are waxing long,
            And all that is,
              Is fair.

        Here are my buds of lily and of rose,
        And here's my namesake-blossom, may;
          And from a watery spot
          See here forget-me-not,
            With all that blows
              To-day.

        Hark to my linnets from the hedges green,
        Blackbird and lark and thrush and dove,
          And every nightingale
          And cuckoo tells its tale,
            And all they mean
              Is love.

    [June appears at the further end of the garden, coming slowly
    towards May, who, seeing her, exclaims]

              _May._

    Surely you're come too early, sister June.

              _June._

    Indeed I feel as if I came too soon
    To round your young May moon
    And set the world a-gasping at my noon.
    Yet come I must. So here are strawberries
    Sun-flushed and sweet, as many as you please;
    And here are full-blown roses by the score,
    More roses, and yet more.

    [May, eating strawberries, withdraws among the flower beds.]

              _June._

    The sun does all my long day's work for me,
      Raises and ripens everything;
    I need but sit beneath a leafy tree
        And watch and sing.

    [Seats herself in the shadow of a laburnum.

    Or if I'm lulled by note of bird and bee,
      Or lulled by noontide's silence deep,
    I need but nestle down beneath my tree
        And drop asleep.

    [June falls asleep; and is not awakened by the voice of July,
    who behind the scenes is heard half singing, half calling.]

              _July._

         [Behind the scenes.]

    Blue flags, yellow flags, flags all freckled,
    Which will you take? yellow, blue, speckled!
    Take which you will, speckled, blue, yellow,
    Each in its way has not a fellow.

    [Enter July, a basket of many-colored irises slung upon his
    shoulders, a bunch of ripe grass in one hand, and a plate
    piled full of peaches balanced upon the other. He steals
    up to June, and tickles her with the grass. She wakes.]

              _June._

    What, here already?

              _July._

                      Nay, my tryst is kept;
    The longest day slipped by you while you slept.
    I've brought you one curved pyramid of bloom,

                            [Hands her the plate.

    Not flowers, but peaches, gathered where the bees,
    As downy, bask and boom
    In sunshine and in gloom of trees.
    But get you in, a storm is at my heels;
    The whirlwind whistles and wheels,
    Lightning flashes and thunder peals,
    Flying and following hard upon my heels.

    [June takes shelter in a thickly-woven arbor.]

              _July._

      The roar of a storm sweeps up
        From the east to the lurid west,
      The darkening sky, like a cup,
        Is filled with rain to the brink;

      The sky is purple and fire,
        Blackness and noise and unrest;
      The earth, parched with desire,
          Opens her mouth to drink.

      Send forth thy thunder and fire,
        Turn over thy brimming cup,
      O sky, appease the desire
        Of earth in her parched unrest;
      Pour out drink to her thirst,
        Her famishing life lift up;
      Make thyself fair as at first,
          With a rainbow for thy crest.

      Have done with thunder and fire,
        O sky with the rainbow crest;
      O earth, have done with desire,
        Drink, and drink deep, and rest.

    [Enter August, carrying a sheaf made up of different kinds of
    grain.]

              _July._

    Hail, brother August, flushed and warm
    And scatheless from my storm.
    Your hands are full of corn, I see,
    As full as hands can be:

    And earth and air both smell as sweet as balm
    In their recovered calm,
    And that they owe to me.

    [July retires into a shrubbery.]

              _August._

      Wheat sways heavy, oats are airy,
        Barley bows a graceful head,
      Short and small shoots up canary,
        Each of these is some one's bread;
      Bread for man or bread for beast,
          Or at very least
          A bird's savory feast.

      Men are brethren of each other,
        One in flesh and one in food;
      And a sort of foster brother
        Is the litter, or the brood,
      Of that folk in fur or feather,
          Who, with men together,
          Breast the wind and weather.

    [August descries September toiling across the lawn.]

              _August._

    My harvest home is ended; and I spy
    September drawing nigh
    With the first thought of Autumn in her eye,
    And the first sigh
    Of Autumn wind among her locks that fly.

    [September arrives, carrying upon her head a basket heaped
    high with fruit]


              _September._

    Unload me, brother. I have brought a few
    Plums and these pears for you,
    A dozen kinds of apples, one or two
    Melons, some figs all bursting through
    Their skins, and pearled with dew
    These damsons violet-blue.

    [While September is speaking, August lifts the basket to the
    ground, selects various fruits, and withdraws slowly along
    the gravel walk, eating a pear as he goes.]

              _September._

        My song is half a sigh
        Because my green leaves die;
    Sweet are my fruits, but all my leaves are dying;
        And well may Autumn sigh,
          And well may I
      Who watch the sere leaves flying.

        My leaves that fade and fall,
        I note you one and all;
    I call you, and the Autumn wind is calling,
        Lamenting for your fall,
          And for the pall
      You spread on earth in falling.

    And here's a song of flowers to suit such hours:
    A song of the last lilies, the last flowers,
    Amid my withering bowers.

        In the sunny garden bed
          Lilies look so pale,
        Lilies droop the head
          In the shady grassy vale;
        If all alike they pine
        In shade and in shine,
        If everywhere they grieve,
        Where will lilies live?

    [October enters briskly, some leafy twigs bearing different
    sorts of nuts in one hand, and a long ripe hop-bine trailing
    after him from the other. A dahlia is stuck in his
    buttonhole.]

              _October._

    Nay, cheer up, sister. Life is not quite over,
    Even if the year has done with corn and clover,
    With flowers and leaves; besides, in fact it's true,
    Some leaves remain and some flowers too.
    For me and you.
    Now see my crops:

                [Offering his produce to September.

                I've brought you nuts and hops;
    And when the leaf drops, why, the walnut drops.


    [October wreaths the hop-bine about September's neck, and
    gives her the nut twigs. They enter the cottage together,
    but without shutting the door. She steps into the background:
    he advances to the hearth, removes the guard,
    stirs up the smouldering fire, and arranges several chestnuts
    ready to roast.]

              _October._

    Crack your first nut and light your first fire,
      Roast your first chestnut crisp on the bar;
    Make the logs sparkle, stir the blaze higher;
      Logs are cheery as sun or as star,
      Logs we can find wherever we are.

    Spring one soft day will open the leaves,
      Spring one bright day will lure back the flowers;
    Never fancy my whistling wind grieves,
      Never fancy I've tears in my showers;
      Dance, nights and days! and dance on, my hours!

                [Sees November approaching.

              _October._

    Here comes my youngest sister, looking dim
    And grim,
    With dismal ways.
    What cheer, November?

              _November._

    [Entering and shutting the door.]

    Nought have I to bring,
    Tramping a-chill and shivering,
    Except these pine-cones for a blaze,--
    Except a fog which follows,
    And stuffs up all the hollows,--
    Except a hoar frost here and there,--
    Except some shooting stars
    Which dart their luminous cars
    Trackless and noiseless through the keen night air.

    [October, shrugging his shoulders, withdraws into the background,
    while November throws her pine cones on the
    fire, and sits down listlessly.]

              _November._

    The earth lies fast asleep, grown tired
      Of all that's high or deep;
    There's nought desired and nought required
        Save a sleep.

    I rock the cradle of the earth,
      I lull her with a sigh;
    And know that she will wake to mirth
        By and by.

    [Through the window December is seen running and leaping
    in the direction of the door. He knocks.]

              _November._

    [Calls out without rising.]

    Ah, here's my youngest brother come at last:
    Come in, December.

    [He opens the door and enters, loaded with evergreens in
    berry, etc.]

              _November._

                Come, and shut the door,
    For now it's snowing fast;
    It snows, and will snow more and more;
    Don't let it drift in on the floor.
    But you, you're all aglow; how can you be
    Rosy and warm and smiling in the cold?

              _December._

    Nay, no closed doors for me,
    But open doors and open hearts and glee
    To welcome young and old.

      Dimmest and brightest month am I;
    My short days end, my lengthening days begin;
    What matters more or less sun in the sky,
        When all is sun within?

                   [He begins making a wreath as he sings.

      Ivy and privet dark as night,
    I weave with hips and haws a cheerful show,
    And holly for a beauty and delight,
        And milky mistletoe.

      While high above them all I set
    Yew twigs and Christmas roses pure and pale;
    Then Spring her snowdrop and her violet
        May keep, so sweet and frail;

      May keep each merry singing bird,
    Of all her happy birds that singing build:
    For I've a carol which some shepherds heard
        Once in a wintry field.

    [While December concludes his song all the other Months
    troop in from the garden, or advance out of the background.
    The Twelve join hands in a circle, and begin
    dancing round to a stately measure as the Curtain falls.]



    PASTIME.


    A boat amid the ripples, drifting, rocking,
      Two idle people, without pause or aim;
    While in the ominous west there gathers darkness
        Flushed with flame.

    A haycock in a hayfield backing, lapping,
      Two drowsy people pillowed round about;
    While in the ominous west across the darkness
        Flame leaps out.

    Better a wrecked life than a life so aimless,
      Better a wrecked life than a life so soft;
    The ominous west glooms thundering, with its fire
        Lit aloft.



    "ITALIA, IO TI SALUTO!"


    To come back from the sweet South, to the North
      Where I was born, bred, look to die;
    Come back to do my day's work in its day,
          Play out my play--
      Amen, amen, say I.

    To see no more the country half my own,
      Nor hear the half familiar speech,
    Amen, I say; I turn to that bleak North
          Whence I came forth--
      The South lies out of reach.

    But when our swallows fly back to the South,
      To the sweet South, to the sweet South,
    The tears may come again into my eyes
          On the old wise,
      And the sweet name to my mouth.



    MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.


    The mystery of Life, the mystery
    Of Death, I see
    Darkly as in a glass;
    Their shadows pass,
    And talk with me.

    As the flush of a Morning Sky,
    As a Morning Sky colorless--
    Each yields its measure of light
    To a wet world or a dry;
    Each fares through day to night
    With equal pace,
    And then each one
    Is done.

    As the Sun with glory and grace
    In his face,
    Benignantly hot,
    Graciously radiant and keen,
    Ready to rise and to run,--
    Not without spot,
    Not even the Sun.

    As the Moon
    On the wax, on the wane,
    With night for her noon;
    Vanishing soon,
    To appear again.

    As Roses that droop
    Half warm, half chill, in the languid May,
    And breathe out a scent
    Sweet and faint;
    Till the wind gives one swoop
    To scatter their beauty away.

    As Lilies a multitude,
    One dipping, one rising, one sinking,
    On rippling waters, clear blue
    And pure for their drinking;
    One new dead, and one opened anew,
    And all good.

    As a cankered pale Flower,
    With death for a dower,
    Each hour of its life half dead;
    With death for a crown
    Weighing down
    Its head.

    As an Eagle, half strength and half grace,
    Most potent to face
    Unwinking the splendor of light;
    Harrying the East and the West,
    Soaring aloft from our sight;
    Yet one day or one night dropped to rest,
    On the low common earth
    Of his birth.

    As a Dove,
    Not alone,
    In a world of her own
    Full of fluttering soft noises
    And tender sweet voices
    Of love.

    As a Mouse
    Keeping house
    In the fork of a tree,
    With nuts in a crevice,
    And an acorn or two;
    What cares he
    For blossoming boughs,
    Or the song-singing bevies
    Of birds in their glee,
    Scarlet, or golden, or blue?

    As a Mole grubbing underground;
    When it comes to the light
    It grubs its way back again,
    Feeling no bias of fur
    To hamper it in its stir,
    Scant of pleasure and pain,
    Sinking itself out of sight
    Without sound.

    As Waters that drop and drop,
    Weariness without end,
    That drop and never stop,
    Wear that nothing can mend,
    Till one day they drop--
    Stop--
    And there's an end,
    And matters mend.

    As Trees, beneath whose skin
    We mark not the sap begin
    To swell and rise,
    Till the whole bursts out in green:
    We mark the falling leaves
    When the wide world grieves
    And sighs.

    As a Forest on fire,
    Where maddened creatures desire
    Wet mud or wings
    Beyond all those things
    Which could assuage desire
    On this side the flaming fire.

    As Wind with a sob and sigh
    To which there comes no reply
    But a rustle and shiver
    From rushes of the river;
    As Wind with a desolate moan,
    Moaning on alone.

    As a Desert all sand,
    Blank, neither water nor land
    For solace, or dwelling, or culture,
    Where the storms and the wild creatures howl;
    Given over to lion and vulture,
    To ostrich, and jackal, and owl:
    Yet somewhere an oasis lies;
    There waters arise
    To nourish one seedling of balm,
    Perhaps, or one palm.

    As the Sea,
    Murmuring, shifting, swaying;
    One time sunnily playing,
    One time wrecking and slaying;
    In whichever mood it be,
    Worst or best,
    Never at rest.

    As still Waters and deep,
    As shallow Waters that brawl,
    As rapid Waters that leap
    To their fall.

    As Music, as Color, as Shape,
    Keys of rapture and pain
    Turning in vain
    In a lock which turns not again,
    While breaths and moments escape.

    As Spring, all bloom and desire;
    As Summer, all gift and fire;
    As Autumn, a dying glow;
    As Winter, with nought to show:

    Winter which lays its dead all out of sight,
    All clothed in white,
    All waiting for the long-awaited light.



    A BALLAD OF BODING.


    There are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
    What seems is not always as it seems.

    I looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
    And there I saw three barges of manifold adorning
    Went sailing toward the East:
    The first had sails like fire,
    The next like glittering wire,
    But sackcloth were the sails of the least;
    And all the crews made music, and two had spread a feast.

    The first choir breathed in flutes,
    And fingered soft guitars;
    The second won from lutes
    Harmonious chords and jars,
    With drums for stormy bars:
    But the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;
    Notes of triumph, then
    An alarm again,
    As for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,
    Peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.

    The first barge showed for figurehead a Love with wings;
    The second showed for figurehead a Worm with stings;
    The third, a Lily tangled to a Rose which clings.
    The first bore for freight gold and spice and down;
    The second bore a sword, a sceptre, and a crown;
    The third, a heap of earth gone to dust and brown.
    Winged Love meseemed like Folly in the face;
    Stinged Worm meseemed loathly in his place;
    Lily and Rose were flowers of grace.

    Merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew,
    Singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:
    Pleasures ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;
    Sighs, but scarce of woe;
    All the sighing
    Wooed such sweet replying;
    All the sighing, sweet and low,
    Used to come and go
    For more pleasure, merely so.
    Yet at intervals some one grew tired
    Of everything desired,
    And sank, I knew not whither, in sorry plight,
    Out of sight.

    The second crew seemed ever
    Wider-visioned, graver,
    More distinct of purpose, more sustained of will;
    With heads erect and proud,
    And voices sometimes loud;
    With endless tacking, counter-tacking,
    All things grasping, all things lacking,
    It would seem;
    Ever shifting helm, or sail, or shroud,
    Drifting on as in a dream.
    Hoarding to their utmost bent,
    Feasting to their fill,
    Yet gnawed by discontent,
    Envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went.
    Their freight was not a treasure,
    Their music not a pleasure;
    The sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,
    Sceptre and crown changed hands.

    The third crew as they went
    Seemed mostly different;
    They toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was contrary,
    As all the world might see.
    They labored at the oar,
    While on their heads they bore
    The fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
    They labored at the oar hand-sore,
    Till rain went splashing,
    And spray went dashing,
    Down on them, and up on them, more and more.
    Their sails were patched and rent,
    Their masts were bent,
    In peril of their lives they worked and went.
    For them no feast was spread,
    No soft luxurious bed
    Scented and white,
    No crown or sceptre hung in sight;
    In weariness and painfulness,
    In thirst and sore distress,
    They rowed and steered from left to right
    With all their might.
    Their trumpeters and harpers round about
    Incessantly played out,
    And sometimes they made answer with a shout;
    But oftener they groaned or wept,
    And seldom paused to eat, and seldom slept.
    I wept for pity watching them, but more
    I wept heart-sore
    Once and again to see
    Some weary man plunge overboard, and swim
    To Love or Worm ship floating buoyantly:
    And there all welcomed him.

    The ships steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,
    Yet all the crews were interchangeable;
    Now one man, now another,
    --Like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,--
    Changed openly, or changed by stealth,
    Scaling a slippery side, and scaled it well.
    The most left Love ship, hauling wealth
    Up Worm ship's side;
    While some few hollow-eyed
    Left either for the sack-sailed boat;
    But this, though not remote,
    Was worst to mount, and whoso left it once
    Scarce ever came again,
    But seemed to loathe his erst companions,
    And wish and work them bane.

    Then I knew (I know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
    Rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed,
    Whence a waterspout
    Instantaneously leaped out,
    Roaring as it reared its head.

    Soon I spied a something dim,
    Many-handed, grim,
    That went flitting to and fro the first and second ship;
    It puffed their sails full out
    With puffs of smoky breath
    From a smouldering lip,
    And cleared the waterspout
    Which reeled roaring round about
    Threatening death.
    With a horny hand it steered,
    And a horn appeared
    On its sneering head upreared
    Haughty and high
    Against the blackening lowering sky.
    With a hoof it swayed the waves;
    They opened here and there,
    Till I spied deep ocean graves
    Full of skeletons
    That were men and women once
    Foul or fair;
    Full of things that creep
    And fester in the deep
    And never breathe the clean life-nurturing air.

    The third bark held aloof
    From the Monster with the hoof,
    Despite his urgent beck,
    And fraught with guile
    Abominable his smile;
    Till I saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.
    Then full of awe,
    With these same eyes I saw
    His head incredible retract its horn
    Rounding like babe's new born,
    While silvery phosphorescence played
    About his dis-horned head.
    The sneer smoothed from his lip,
    He beamed blandly on the ship;
    All winds sank to a moan,
    All waves to a monotone
    (For all these seemed his realm),
    While he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

    Then a cry well nigh of despair
    Shrieked to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer.
    The harpers harped no more,
    While the trumpeters sounded sore
    An alarm to wake the dead from their bed:
    To the rescue, to the rescue, now or never,
    To the rescue, O ye living, O ye dead,
    Or no more help or hope for ever!--
    The planks strained as though they must part asunder,
    The masts bent as though they must dip under,
    And the winds and the waves at length
    Girt up their strength,
    And the depths were laid bare,
    And heaven flashed fire and volleyed thunder
    Through the rain-choked air,
    And sea and sky seemed to kiss
    In the horror and the hiss
    Of the whole world shuddering everywhere.

    Lo! a Flyer swooping down
    With wings to span the globe,
    And splendor for his robe
    And splendor for his crown.
    He lighted on the helm with a foot of fire,
    And spun the Monster overboard:
    And that monstrous thing abhorred,
    Gnashing with balked desire,
    Wriggled like a worm infirm
    Up the Worm
    Of the loathly figurehead.
    There he crouched and gnashed;
    And his head re-horned, and gashed
    From the other's grapple, dripped bloody red.

    I saw that thing accurst
    Wreak his worst
    On the first and second crew:
    Some with baited hook
    He angled for and took,
    Some dragged overboard in a net he threw,
    Some he did to death
    With hoof or horn or blasting breath.

    I heard a voice of wailing
    Where the ships went sailing,
    A sorrowful voice prevailing
    Above the sound of the sea,
    Above the singers' voices,
    And musical merry noises;
    All songs had turned to sighing,
    The light was failing,
    The day was dying--
    Ah me,
    That such a sorrow should be!

    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
    When Love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand
    To its grave in the bitter wave.
    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
    When Worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand,
    And the bitter wave was its grave.
    But land and sea waxed hoary
    In whiteness of a glory
    Never told in story
    Nor seen by mortal eye,
    When the third ship crossed the bar
    Where whirls and breakers are,
    And steered into the splendors of the sky;
    That third bark and that least
    Which had never seemed to feast,
    Yet kept high festival above sun and moon and star.



    YET A LITTLE WHILE.


    I dreamed and did not seek: to-day I seek
        Who can no longer dream;
    But now am all behindhand, waxen weak,
      And dazed amid so many things that gleam
        Yet are not what they seem.

    I dreamed and did not work: to-day I work
        Kept wide awake by care
    And loss, and perils dimly guessed to lurk;
      I work and reap not, while my life goes bare
        And void in wintry air.

    I hope indeed; but hope itself is fear
        Viewed on the sunny side;
    I hope, and disregard the world that's here,
      The prizes drawn, the sweet things that betide;
        I hope, and I abide.



    HE AND SHE.


    "Should one of us remember,
      And one of us forget,
    I wish I knew what each will do--
      But who can tell as yet?"

    "Should one of us remember,
      And one of us forget,
    I promise you what I will do--
    And I'm content to wait for you,
      And not be sure as yet."



    MONNA INNOMINATA.

    A SONNET OF SONNETS.


    Beatrice, immortalized by "altissimo poeta ... cotanto
    amante;" Laura, celebrated by a great though an inferior bard,--have
    alike paid the exceptional penalty of exceptional honor,
    and have come down to us resplendent with charms, but (at
    least, to my apprehension) scant of attractiveness.

    These heroines of world-wide fame were preceded by a bevy
    of unnamed ladies "donne innominate" sung by a school of
    less conspicuous poets; and in that land and that period which
    gave simultaneous birth to Catholics, to Albigenses, and to
    Troubadours, one can imagine many a lady as sharing her
    lover's poetic aptitude, while the barrier between them might
    be one held sacred by both, yet not such as to render mutual
    love incompatible with mutual honor.

    Had such a lady spoken for herself, the portrait left us might
    have appeared more tender, if less dignified, than any drawn
    even by a devoted friend. Or had the Great Poetess of our
    own day and nation only been unhappy instead of happy, her
    circumstances would have invited her to bequeath to us, in
    lieu of the "Portuguese Sonnets," an inimitable "donna innominata"
    drawn not from fancy but from feeling, and worthy
    to occupy a niche beside Beatrice and Laura.


    1.

    "Lo di che han detto a' dolci amici addio."--Dante.
    "Amor, con quanto sforzo oggi mi vinci!"--Petrarca.



    Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:--
      Or come not yet, for it is over then,
      And long it is before you come again,
    So far between my pleasures are and few.
    While, when you come not, what I do I do
      Thinking "Now when he comes," my sweetest "when:"
      For one man is my world of all the men
    This wide world holds; O love, my world is you.
    Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang
      Because the pang of parting comes so soon;
      My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon
        Between the heavenly days on which we meet:
    Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang
        When life was sweet because you called them sweet?


    2.


    "Era già l'ora che volge il desio."--Dante.
    "Ricorro al tempo ch' io vi vidi prima."--Petrarca.


    I wish I could remember that first day,
      First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
      If bright or dim the season, it might be
    Summer or Winter for aught I can say;
    So unrecorded did it slip away,
      So blind was I to see and to foresee,
      So dull to mark the budding of my tree
    That would not blossom yet for many a May.
    If only I could recollect it, such
      A day of days! I let it come and go
      As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
    It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;
    If only now I could recall that touch,
      First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know!


    3.

    "O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto!"--Dante.
    "Immaginata guida la conduce."--Petrarca.


    I dream of you to wake: would that I might
      Dream of you and not wake but slumber on;
      Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone,
    As Summer ended Summer birds take flight.
    In happy dreams I hold you full in sight,
      I blush again who waking look so wan;
      Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone,
    In happy dreams your smile makes day of night.
    Thus only in a dream we are at one,
      Thus only in a dream we give and take
        The faith that maketh rich who take or give;
      If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,
        To die were surely sweeter than to live,
    Though there be nothing new beneath the sun.


    4.

    "Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda."--Dante.
    "Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
    E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore."--Petrarca.


    I loved you first: but afterwards your love
      Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
    As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
      Which owes the other most? my love was long,
      And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
    I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
    And loved me for what might or might not be--
      Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
    For verily love knows not "mine" or "thine;"
      With separate "I" and "thou" free love has done,
        For one is both and both are one in love:
    Rich love knows nought of "thine that is not mine;"
        Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
      Both of us of the love which makes us one.


    5.

    "Amor che a nulla amato amar perdona."--Dante.
    "Amor m'addusse in si gioiosa spene."--Petrarca.


    O my heart's heart, and you who are to me
      More than myself myself, God be with you,
      Keep you in strong obedience leal and true
    To Him whose noble service setteth free,
    Give you all good we see or can foresee,
      Make your joys many and your sorrows few,
      Bless you in what you bear and what you do,
    Yea, perfect you as He would have you be.
    So much for you; but what for me, dear friend?
      To love you without stint and all I can
    To-day, to-morrow, world without an end;
        To love you much and yet to love you more,
        As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;
      Since woman is the helpmeet made for man.


    6.

                "Or puoi la quantitate
    Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda."--Dante.
    "Non vo' che da tal nodo amor mi scioglia."--Petrarca.


    Trust me, I have not earned your dear rebuke,
      I love, as you would have me, God the most;
      Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,
    Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look
    Unready to forego what I forsook;
      This say I, having counted up the cost,
      This, though I be the feeblest of God's host,
    The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook,
    Yet while I love my God the most, I deem
      That I can never love you overmuch;
        I love Him more, so let me love you too;
      Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such
    I cannot love you if I love not Him,
        I cannot love Him if I love not you.


    7.

    "Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto."--Dante.
    "Ragionando con meco ed io con lui."--Petrarca.


    "Love me, for I love you"--and answer me,
      "Love me, for I love you"--so shall we stand
      As happy equals in the flowering land
    Of love, that knows not a dividing sea.
    Love builds the house on rock and not on sand,
      Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately;
    And who hath found love's citadel unmanned?
      And who hath held in bonds love's liberty?
    My heart's a coward though my words are brave--
      We meet so seldom, yet we surely part
      So often; there's a problem for your art!
        Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith,
    Though jealousy be cruel as the grave,
        And death be strong, yet love is strong as death.


    8.

    "Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme."--Dante.
    "Spero trovar pietà non che perdono."--Petrarca.


    "I, if I perish, perish"--Esther spake:
      And bride of life or death she made her fair
      In all the lustre of her perfumed hair
    And smiles that kindle longing but to slake.
    She put on pomp of loveliness, to take
      Her husband through his eyes at unaware;
      She spread abroad her beauty for a snare,
    Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake.
    She trapped him with one mesh of silken hair,
      She vanquished him by wisdom of her wit,
        And built her people's house that it should stand:--
        If I might take my life so in my hand,
    And for my love to Love put up my prayer,
      And for love's sake by Love be granted it!


    9.

    "O dignitosa coscienza e netta!"--Dante.
    "Spirto più acceso di virtuti ardenti."--Petrarca.


    Thinking of you, and all that was, and all
      That might have been and now can never be,
      I feel your honored excellence, and see
    Myself unworthy of the happier call:
    For woe is me who walk so apt to fall,
      So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee,
      Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!)
    Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall.
    And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite,
    Because not loveless; love may toil all night,
      But take at morning; wrestle till the break
        Of day, but then wield power with God and man:--
        So take I heart of grace as best I can,
      Ready to spend and be spent for your sake.


    10.

    "Con miglior corso e con migliore stella."--Dante.
    "La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora."--Petrarca.


    Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing;
      Death following hard on life gains ground apace;
      Faith runs with each and rears an eager face,
    Outruns the rest, makes light of everything,
    Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing;
      While love ahead of all uplifts his praise,
      Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace,
    Content with all day brings and night will bring.
    Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above
      Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse,
        Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace:
        A little while, and age and sorrow cease;
      A little while, and life reborn annuls
    Loss and decay and death, and all is love.


    11.

    "Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti."--Dante.
    "Contando i casi della vita nostra."--Petrarca.


    Many in aftertimes will say of you
    "He loved her"--while of me what will they say?
      Not that I loved you more than just in play,
    For fashion's sake as idle women do.
    Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
      Of love and parting in exceeding pain,
      Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
    Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
    But by my heart of love laid bare to you,
      My love that you can make not void nor vain,
    Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
        Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
      I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
        My love of you was life and not a breath.

    12.

    "Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona."--Dante.
    "Amor vien nel bel viso di costei."--Petrarca.


    If there be any one can take my place
      And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve,
      Think not that I can grudge it, but believe
    I do commend you to that nobler grace,
    That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face;
      Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive
      I too am crowned, while bridal crowns I weave,
    And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace.
    For if I did not love you, it might be
      That I should grudge you some one dear delight;
        But since the heart is yours that was mine own,
      Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right,
    Your honorable freedom makes me free,
        And you companioned I am not alone.


    13.

    "E drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore."--Dante.
    "Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia."--Petrarca.


    If I could trust mine own self with your fate,
      Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand?
      Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand,
    Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date;
      Who numbereth the innumerable sand,
    Who weighs the wind and water with a weight,
    To Whom the world is neither small nor great,
      Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned.
    Searching my heart for all that touches you,
      I find there only love and love's goodwill
    Helpless to help and impotent to do,
        Of understanding dull, of sight most dim;
        And therefore I commend you back to Him
      Whose love your love's capacity can fill.


    14.

    "E la Sua Volontade è nostra pace."--Dante.
    "Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome."--Petrarca.


    Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there
      Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this;
      Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss?
    I will not bind fresh roses in my hair,
    To shame a cheek at best but little fair,--
      Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,--
    I will not seek for blossoms anywhere,
      Except such common flowers as blow with corn.
    Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain?
      The longing of a heart pent up forlorn,
        A silent heart whose silence loves and longs;
        The silence of a heart which sang its songs
      While youth and beauty made a summer morn,
    Silence of love that cannot sing again.



    "LUSCIOUS AND SORROWFUL."


    Beautiful, tender, wasting away for sorrow;
    Thus to-day; and how shall it be with thee to-morrow?
        Beautiful, tender--what else?
            A hope tells.

    Beautiful, tender, keeping the jubilee
    In the land of home together, past death and sea;
        No more change or death, no more
            Salt sea-shore.



    DE PROFUNDIS.


    Oh why is heaven built so far,
      Oh why is earth set so remote?
    I cannot reach the nearest star
        That hangs afloat.

    I would not care to reach the moon,
      One round monotonous of change;
    Yet even she repeats her tune
        Beyond my range.

    I never watch the scattered fire
      Of stars, or sun's far-trailing train,
    But all my heart is one desire,
        And all in vain:

    For I am bound with fleshly bands,
      Joy, beauty, lie beyond my scope;
    I strain my heart, I stretch my hands,
        And catch at hope.



    TEMPUS FUGIT.


    Lovely Spring,
    A brief sweet thing,
    Is swift on the wing;
    Gracious Summer,
    A slow sweet comer,
    Hastens past;
    Autumn while sweet
    Is all incomplete
    With a moaning blast,--
    Nothing can last,
    Can be cleaved unto,
    Can be dwelt upon;
    It is hurried through,
    It is come and gone,
    Undone it cannot be done,
    It is ever to do,
    Ever old, ever new,
    Ever waxing old
    And lapsing to Winter cold.



    GOLDEN GLORIES.


    The buttercup is like a golden cup,
      The marigold is like a golden frill,
    The daisy with a golden eye looks up,
      And golden spreads the flag beside the rill,
      And gay and golden nods the daffodil,
    The gorsey common swells a golden sea,
      The cowslip hangs a head of golden tips,
    And golden drips the honey which the bee
      Sucks from sweet hearts of flowers and stores and sips.



    JOHNNY.

    FOUNDED ON AN ANECDOTE OF THE FIRST FRENCH REVOLUTION.


    Johnny had a golden head
      Like a golden mop in blow,
    Right and left his curls would spread
      In a glory and a glow,
    And they framed his honest face
    Like stray sunbeams out of place.

    Long and thick, they half could hide
      How threadbare his patched jacket hung;
    They used to be his Mother's pride;
      She praised them with a tender tongue,
    And stroked them with a loving finger
    That smoothed and stroked and loved to linger.

    On a doorstep Johnny sat,
      Up and down the street looked he;
    Johnny did not own a hat,
      Hot or cold tho' days might be;
    Johnny did not own a boot
    To cover up his muddy foot.

    Johnny's face was pale and thin,
      Pale with hunger and with crying;
    For his Mother lay within,
      Talked and tossed and seemed a-dying,
    While Johnny racked his brains to think
    How to get her help and drink,

    Get her physic, get her tea,
      Get her bread and something nice;
    Not a penny piece had he,
      And scarce a shilling might suffice;
    No wonder that his soul was sad,
    When not one penny piece he had.

    As he sat there thinking, moping,
      Because his Mother's wants were many,
    Wishing much but scarcely hoping
      To earn a shilling or a penny,
    A friendly neighbor passed him by
    And questioned him: Why did he cry?

    Alas! his trouble soon was told:
      He did not cry for cold or hunger,
    Though he was hungry both and cold;
      He only felt more weak and younger,
    Because he wished so to be old
    And apt at earning pence or gold.

    Kindly that neighbor was, but poor,
      Scant coin had he to give or lend;
    And well he guessed there needed more
      Than pence or shillings to befriend
    The helpless woman in her strait,
    So much loved, yet so desolate.

    One way he saw, and only one:
      He would--he could not--give the advice,
    And yet he must: the widow's son
      Had curls of gold would fetch their price;
    Long curls which might be clipped, and sold
    For silver, or perhaps for gold.

    Our Johnny, when he understood
      Which shop it was that purchased hair,
    Ran off as briskly as he could,
      And in a trice stood cropped and bare,
    Too short of hair to fill a locket,
    But jingling money in his pocket.

    Precious money--tea and bread,
      Physic, ease, for Mother dear,
    Better than a golden head:
      Yet our hero dropped one tear
    When he spied himself close shorn,
    Barer much than lamb new born.

    His Mother throve upon the money,
      Ate and revived and kissed her son:
    But oh! when she perceived her Johnny,
      And understood what he had done
    All and only for her sake,
    She sobbed as if her heart must break.



    "HOLLOW-SOUNDING AND MYSTERIOUS."


    There's no replying
    To the Wind's sighing,
    Telling, foretelling,
    Dying, undying,
    Dwindling and swelling,
    Complaining, droning,
    Whistling and moaning,
    Ever beginning,
    Ending, repeating,
    Hinting and dinning,
    Lagging and fleeting--
    We've no replying
    Living or dying
    To the Wind's sighing.

    What are you telling,
    Variable Wind-tone?
    What would be teaching,
    O sinking, swelling,
    Desolate Wind-moan?
    Ever for ever
    Teaching and preaching,
    Never, ah never
    Making us wiser--
    The earliest riser
    Catches no meaning,
    The last who hearkens
    Garners no gleaning
    Of wisdom's treasure,
    While the world darkens:--
    Living or dying,
    In pain, in pleasure,
    We've no replying
    To wordless flying
    Wind's sighing.



    MAIDEN MAY.


    Maiden May sat in her bower,
    In her blush rose bower in flower,
          Sweet of scent;
    Sat and dreamed away an hour,
      Half content, half uncontent.

    "Why should rose blossoms be born,
    Tender blossoms, on a thorn
          Though so sweet?
    Never a thorn besets the corn
      Scentless in its strength complete.

    "Why are roses all so frail,
    At the mercy of the gale,
          Of a breath?
    Yet so sweet and perfect pale,
      Still so sweet in life and death."

    Maiden May sat in her bower,
    In her blush rose bower in flower,
          Where a linnet
    Made one bristling branch the tower
      For her nest and young ones in it.

    "Gay and clear the linnet trills;
    Yet the skylark only, thrills
          Heaven and earth
    When he breasts the height, and fills
      Height and depth with song and mirth.

    "Nightingales which yield to night
    Solitary strange delight,
          Reign alone:
    But the lark for all his height
      Fills no solitary throne;

    "While he sings, a hundred sing;
    Wing their flight below his wing
          Yet in flight;
    Each a lovely joyful thing
      To the measure of its delight.

    "Why then should a lark be reckoned
    One alone, without a second
          Near his throne?
    He in skyward flight unslackened,
      In his music, not alone."

    Maiden May sat in her bower;
    Her own face was like a flower
          Of the prime,
    Half in sunshine, half in shower,
      In the year's most tender time.

    Her own thoughts in silent song
    Musically flowed along,
          Wise, unwise,
    Wistful, wondering, weak or strong:
      As brook shallows sink or rise.

    Other thoughts another day,
    Maiden May, will surge and sway
          Round your heart;
    Wake, and plead, and turn at bay,
      Wisdom part, and folly part.

    Time not far remote will borrow
    Other joys, another sorrow,
          All for you;
    Not to-day, and yet to-morrow
      Reasoning false and reasoning true.

    Wherefore greatest? Wherefore least?
    Hearts that starve and hearts that feast?
          You and I?
    Stammering Oracles have ceased,
      And the whole earth stands at "why?"

    Underneath all things that be
    Lies an unsolved mystery;
          Over all
    Spreads a veil impenetrably,
      Spreads a dense unlifted pall.

    Mystery of mysteries:
    _This_ creation hears and sees
          High and low--
    Vanity of vanities:
      _This_ we test and _this_ we know.

    Maiden May, the days of flowering
    Nurse you now in sweet embowering,
          Sunny days;
    Bright with rainbows all the showering,
      Bright with blossoms all the ways.

    Close the inlet of your bower,
    Close it close with thorn and flower,
          Maiden May;
    Lengthen out the shortening hour,--
      Morrows are not as to-day.

    Stay to-day which wanes too soon,
    Stay the sun and stay the moon,
          Stay your youth;
    Bask you in the actual noon,
      Rest you in the present truth.

    Let to-day suffice to-day:
    For itself to-morrow may
          Fetch its loss;
    Aim and stumble, say its say,
      Watch and pray and bear its cross.



    TILL TO-MORROW.


    Long have I longed, till I am tired
        Of longing and desire;
    Farewell my points in vain desired,
            My dying fire;
    Farewell all things that die and fail and tire.

    Springtide and youth and useless pleasure
        And all my useless scheming,
    My hopes of unattainable treasure,
            Dreams not worth dreaming,
    Glow-worms that gleam but yield no warmth in gleaming,

    Farewell all shows that fade in showing:
        My wish and joy stand over
    Until to-morrow; Heaven is glowing
            Through cloudy cover,
    Beyond all clouds loves me my Heavenly Lover.



    DEATH-WATCHES.


    The Spring spreads one green lap of flowers
      Which Autumn buries at the fall,
    No chilling showers of Autumn hours
      Can stay them or recall;
    Winds sing a dirge, while earth lays out of sight
    Her garment of delight.

    The cloven East brings forth the sun,
      The cloven West doth bury him
    What time his gorgeous race is run
      And all the world grows dim;
    A funeral moon is lit in heaven's hollow,
    And pale the star-lights follow.



    TOUCHING "NEVER."


    Because you never yet have loved me, dear,
      Think you you never can nor ever will?
      Surely while life remains hope lingers still,
    Hope the last blossom of life's dying year.
    Because the season and mine age grow sere,
      Shall never Spring bring forth her daffodil,
      Shall never sweeter Summer feast her fill
    Of roses with the nightingales they hear?
    If you had loved me, I not loving you,
      If you had urged me with the tender plea
    Of what our unknown years to come might do
    (Eternal years, if Time should count too few),
      I would have owned the point you pressed on me,
    Was possible, or probable, or true.



    BRANDONS BOTH.


    Oh fair Milly Brandon, a young maid, a fair maid!
      All her curls are yellow and her eyes are blue,
    And her cheeks were rosy red till a secret care made
      Hollow whiteness of their brightness as a care will do.

    Still she tends her flowers, but not as in the old days,
      Still she sings her songs, but not the songs of old:
    If now it be high Summer her days seem brief and cold days,
      If now it be high Summer her nights are long and cold.

    If you have a secret keep it, pure maid Milly;
      Life is filled with troubles and the world with scorn;
    And pity without love is at best times hard and chilly,
      Chilling sore and stinging sore a heart forlorn.

    Walter Brandon, do you guess Milly Brandon's secret?
      Many things you know, but not everything,
    With your locks like raven's plumage, and eyes like an egret,
      And a laugh that is music, and such a voice to sing.

    Nelly Knollys, she is fair, but she is not fairer
      Than fairest Milly Brandon was before she turned so pale:
    Oh, but Nelly's dearer if she be not rarer,
      She need not keep a secret or blush behind a veil.

    Beyond the first green hills, beyond the nearest valleys,
      Nelly dwells at home beneath her mother's eyes:
    Her home is neat and homely, not a cot and not a palace,
      Just the home where love sets up his happiest memories.

    Milly has no mother; and sad beyond another
      Is she whose blessed mother is vanished out of call:
    Truly comfort beyond comfort is stored up in a mother
      Who bears with all, and hopes through all, and loves us all.

    Where peacocks nod and flaunt up and down the terrace,
      Furling and unfurling their scores of sightless eyes,
    To and fro among the leaves and buds and flowers and berries
      Maiden Milly strolls and pauses, smiles and sighs.

    On the hedged-in terrace of her father's palace
      She may stroll and muse alone, may smile or sigh alone,
    Letting thoughts and eyes go wandering over hills and valleys
      To-day her father's, and one day to be all her own.

    If her thoughts go coursing down lowlands and up highlands,
      It is because the startled game are leaping from their lair;
    If her thoughts dart homeward to the reedy river islands,
      It is because the waterfowl rise startled here or there.

    At length a footfall on the steps: she turns, composed and steady,
      All the long-descended greatness of her father's house
    Lifting up her head; and there stands Walter keen and ready
      For hunting or for hawking, a flush upon his brows.

    "Good-morrow, fair cousin." "Good-morrow, fairest cousin:
      The sun has started on his course, and I must start to-day.
    If you have done me one good turn you've done me many a dozen,
      And I shall often think of you, think of you away."

    "Over hill and hollow what quarry will you follow,
      Or what fish will you angle for beside the river's edge?
    There's cloud upon the hill-top and there 's mist deep down the hollow,
      And fog among the rushes and the rustling sedge."

    "I shall speed well enough be it hunting or hawking,
      Or casting a bait towards the shyest daintiest fin.
    But I kiss your hands, my cousin; I must not loiter talking,
      For nothing comes of nothing, and I'm fain to seek and win."

    "Here's a thorny rose: will you wear it an hour,
      Till the petals drop apart still fresh and pink and sweet?
    Till the petals drop from the drooping perished flower,
      And only the graceless thorns are left of it."

    "Nay, I have another rose sprung in another garden,
      Another rose which sweetens all the world for me.
    Be you a tenderer mistress and be you a warier warden
      Of your rose, as sweet as mine, and full as fair to see."

    "Nay, a bud once plucked there is no reviving,
      Nor is it worth your wearing now, nor worth indeed my own;
    The dead to the dead, and the living to the living.
      It's time I go within, for it's time now you were gone."

    "Good-bye, Milly Brandon, I shall not forget you,
      Though it be good-bye between us for ever from to-day;
    I could almost wish to-day that I had never met you,
      And I'm true to you in this one word that I say."

    "Good-bye, Walter. I can guess which thornless rose you covet;
      Long may it bloom and prolong its sunny morn:
    Yet as for my one thorny rose, I do not cease to love it,
      And if it is no more a flower I love it as a thorn."



    A LIFE'S PARALLELS.


    Never on this side of the grave again,
      On this side of the river,
    On this side of the garner of the grain,
                Never,--

    Ever while time flows on and on and on,
      That narrow noiseless river,
    Ever while corn bows heavy-headed, wan,
                Ever,--

    Never despairing, often fainting, ruing,
      But looking back, ah never!
    Faint yet pursuing, faint yet still pursuing
                Ever.



    AT LAST.


    Many have sung of love a root of bane:
      While to my mind a root of balm it is,
      For love at length breeds love; sufficient bliss
    For life and death and rising up again.
    Surely when light of Heaven makes all things plain,
      Love will grow plain with all its mysteries;
      Nor shall we need to fetch from over seas
    Wisdom or wealth or pleasure safe from pain.
    Love in our borders, love within our heart,
      Love all in all, we then shall bide at rest,
      Ended for ever life's unending quest,
        Ended for ever effort, change and fear:
    Love all in all;--no more that better part
        Purchased, but at the cost of all things here.



    GOLDEN SILENCES.


    There is silence that saith, "Ah me!"
      There is silence that nothing saith;
        One the silence of life forlorn,
      One the silence of death;
    One is, and the other shall be.

    One we know and have known for long,
      One we know not, but we shall know,
        All we who have ever been born;
      Even so, be it so,--
    There is silence, despite a song.

    Sowing day is a silent day,
      Resting night is a silent night;
        But whoso reaps the ripened corn
      Shall shout in his delight,
    While silences vanish away.



    IN THE WILLOW SHADE.


    I sat beneath a willow tree,
      Where water falls and calls;
    While fancies upon fancies solaced me,
      Some true, and some were false.

    Who set their heart upon a hope
      That never comes to pass,
    Droop in the end like fading heliotrope,
      The sun's wan looking-glass.

    Who set their will upon a whim
      Clung to through good and ill,
    Are wrecked alike whether they sink or swim,
      Or hit or miss their will.

    All things are vain that wax and wane,
      For which we waste our breath;
    Love only doth not wane and is not vain,
      Love only outlives death.

    A singing lark rose toward the sky,
      Circling he sang amain;
    He sang, a speck scarce visible sky-high,
      And then he sank again.

    A second like a sunlit spark
      Flashed singing up his track;
    But never overtook that foremost lark,
      And songless fluttered back.

    A hovering melody of birds
      Haunted the air above;
    They clearly sang contentment without words,
      And youth and joy and love.

    O silvery weeping willow tree
      With all leaves shivering,
    Have you no purpose but to shadow me
      Beside this rippled spring?

    On this first fleeting day of Spring,
      For Winter is gone by,
    And every bird on every quivering wing
      Floats in a sunny sky;

    On this first Summer-like soft day,
      While sunshine steeps the air,
    And every cloud has gat itself away,
      And birds sing everywhere.

    Have you no purpose in the world
      But thus to shadow me
    With all your tender drooping twigs unfurled,
      O weeping willow tree?

    With all your tremulous leaves outspread
      Betwixt me and the sun,
    While here I loiter on a mossy bed
      With half my work undone;

    My work undone, that should be done
      At once with all my might;
    For after the long day and lingering sun
      Comes the unworking night.

    This day is lapsing on its way,
      Is lapsing out of sight;
    And after all the chances of the day
      Comes the resourceless night.

    The weeping-willow shook its head
      And stretched its shadow long;
    The west grew crimson, the sun smouldered red,
      The birds forbore a song.

    Slow wind sighed through the willow leaves,
      The ripple made a moan,
    The world drooped murmuring like a thing that grieves;
      And then I felt alone.

    I rose to go, and felt the chill,
      And shivered as I went;
    Yet shivering wondered, and I wonder still,
      What more that willow meant;

    That silvery weeping-willow tree
      With all leaves shivering,
    Which spent one long day overshadowing me
      Beside a spring in Spring.



    FLUTTERED WINGS.


      The splendor of the kindling day,
        The splendor of the setting sun,
      These move my soul to wend its way,
          And have done
    With all we grasp and toil amongst and say.

      The paling roses of a cloud,
        The fading bow that arches space,
      These woo my fancy toward my shroud;
          Toward the place
    Of faces veiled, and heads discrowned and bowed.

      The nation of the awful stars,
        The wandering star whose blaze is brief,
      These make me beat against the bars
          Of my grief;
    My tedious grief, twin to the life it mars.

      O fretted heart tossed to and fro,
        So fain to flee, so fain to rest!
      All glories that are high or low,
          East or west,
    Grow dim to thee who art so fain to go.



    A FISHER-WIFE.


    The soonest mended, nothing said;
      And help may rise from east or west;
    But my two hands are lumps of lead,
      My heart sits leaden in my breast.

    O north wind swoop not from the north,
      O south wind linger in the south,
    Oh come not raving raging forth,
      To bring my heart into my mouth;

    For I've a husband out at sea,
      Afloat on feeble planks of wood;
    He does not know what fear may be;
      I would have told him if I could.

    I would have locked him in my arms,
      I would have hid him in my heart;
    For oh! the waves are fraught with harms,
      And he and I so far apart.



    WHAT'S IN A NAME?


    Why has Spring one syllable less
    Than any its fellow season?
    There may be some other reason,
    And I'm merely making a guess;
    But surely it hoards such wealth
    Of happiness, hope and health,
    Sunshine and musical sound,
    It may spare a foot from its name
    Yet all the same
    Superabound.

    Soft-named Summer,
    Most welcome comer,
    Brings almost everything
    Over which we dream or sing
    Or sigh;
    But then Summer wends its way,
    To-morrow,--to-day,--
    Good-bye!

    Autumn,--the slow name lingers,
    While we likewise flag;
    It silences many singers;
    Its slow days drag,
    Yet hasten at speed
    To leave us in chilly need
    For Winter to strip indeed.

    In all-lack Winter,
    Dull of sense and of sound,
    We huddle and shiver
    Beside our splinter
    Of crackling pine,
    Snow in sky and snow on ground.
    Winter and cold
    Can't last for ever!
    To-day, to-morrow, the sun will shine;
    When we are old,
    But some still are young,
    Singing the song
    Which others have sung,
    Ringing the bells
    Which others have rung,--
    Even so!
    We ourselves, who else?
    We ourselves long
    Long ago.



    MARIANA.


    Not for me marring or making,
    Not for me giving or taking;
      I love my Love and he loves not me,
    I love my Love and my heart is breaking.

    Sweet is Spring in its lovely showing,
    Sweet the violet veiled in blowing,
      Sweet it is to love and be loved;
    Ah, sweet knowledge beyond my knowing!

    Who sighs for love sighs but for pleasure,
    Who wastes for love hoards up a treasure;
      Sweet to be loved and take no count,
    Sweet it is to love without measure.

    Sweet my Love whom I loved to try for,
    Sweet my Love whom I love and sigh for,
      Will you once love me and sigh for me,
    You my Love whom I love and die for?



    MEMENTO MORI.


    Poor the pleasure
    Doled out by measure,
    Sweet though it be, while brief
    As falling of the leaf;
    Poor is pleasure
    By weight and measure.

    Sweet the sorrow
    Which ends to-morrow;
    Sharp though it be and sore,
    It ends for evermore:
    Zest of sorrow,
    What ends to-morrow.



    "ONE FOOT ON SEA, AND ONE ON SHORE."


    "Oh tell me once and tell me twice
      And tell me thrice to make it plain,
    When we who part this weary day,
      When we who part shall meet again."

    "When windflowers blossom on the sea
      And fishes skim along the plain,
    Then we who part this weary day,
      Then you and I shall meet again."

    "Yet tell me once before we part,
      Why need we part who part in pain?
    If flowers must blossom on the sea,
      Why, we shall never meet again.

    "My cheeks are paler than a rose,
      My tears are salter than the main,
    My heart is like a lump of ice
      If we must never meet again."

    "Oh weep or laugh, but let me be,
      And live or die, for all's in vain;
    For life's in vain since we must part,
      And parting must not meet again

    "Till windflowers blossom on the sea,
      And fishes skim along the plain;
    Pale rose of roses let me be,
      Your breaking heart breaks mine again."



    BUDS AND BABIES.


    A million buds are born that never blow,
      That sweet with promise lift a pretty head
      To blush and wither on a barren bed
        And leave no fruit to show.

    Sweet, unfulfilled. Yet have I understood
      One joy, by their fragility made plain:
      Nothing was ever beautiful in vain,
        Or all in vain was good.



    BOY JOHNNY.


    "If you'll busk you as a bride
      And make ready,
    It's I will wed you with a ring,
      O fair lady."

    "Shall I busk me as a bride,
      I so bonny,
    For you to wed me with a ring,
      O boy Johnny?"

    "When you've busked you as a bride
      And made ready,
    Who else is there to marry you,
      O fair lady?"

    "I will find my lover out,
      I so bonny,
    And you shall bear my wedding-train,
      O boy Johnny."



    FREAKS OF FASHION.


    Such a hubbub in the nests,
      Such a bustle and squeak!
    Nestlings, guiltless of a feather,
      Learning just to speak,
    Ask--"And how about the fashions?"
      From a cavernous beak.

    Perched on bushes, perched on hedges,
      Perched on firm hahas,
    Perched on anything that holds them,
      Gay papas and grave mammas
    Teach the knowledge-thirsty nestlings:
      Hear the gay papas.

    Robin says: "A scarlet waistcoat
      Will be all the wear,
    Snug, and also cheerful-looking
      For the frostiest air,
    Comfortable for the chest too
      When one comes to plume and pair."

    "Neat gray hoods will be in vogue,"
      Quoth a Jackdaw: "Glossy gray,
    Setting close, yet setting easy,
      Nothing fly-away;
    Suited to our misty mornings,
      _A la negligée_."

    Flushing salmon, flushing sulphur,
      Haughty Cockatoos
    Answer--"Hoods may do for mornings,
      But for evenings choose
    High head-dresses, curved like crescents,
      Such as well-bred persons use."

    "Top-knots, yes; yet more essential
      Still, a train or tail,"
    Screamed the Peacock: "Gemmed and lustrous
      Not too stiff, and not too frail;
    Those are best which rearrange as
      Fans, and spread or trail."

    Spoke the Swan, entrenched behind
      An inimitable neck:
    "After all, there's nothing sweeter
      For the lawn or lake
    Than simple white, if fine and flaky
      And absolutely free from speck."

    "Yellow," hinted a Canary,
      "Warmer, not less _distingué_."
    "Peach color," put in a Lory,
      "Cannot look _outré_."
    "All the colors are in fashion,
      And are right," the Parrots say.

    "Very well. But do contrast
      Tints harmonious,"
    Piped a Blackbird, justly proud
      Of bill aurigerous;
    "Half the world may learn a lesson
      As to that from us."

    Then a Stork took up the word:
      "Aim at height and _chic_:
    Not high heels, they're common; somehow,
      Stilted legs, not thick,
    Nor yet thin:" he just glanced downward
      And snapped to his beak.

    Here a rustling and a whirring,
      As of fans outspread,
    Hinted that mammas felt anxious
      Lest the next thing said
    Might prove less than quite judicious,
      Or even underbred.

    So a mother Auk resumed
      The broken thread of speech:
    "Let colors sort themselves, my dears,
      Yellow, or red, or peach;
    The main points, as it seems to me,
      We mothers have to teach,

    "Are form and texture, elegance,
      An air reserved, sublime;
    The mode of wearing what we wear
      With due regard to month and clime.
    But now, let's all compose ourselves,
      It's almost breakfast-time."

    A hubbub, a squeak, a bustle!
      Who cares to chatter or sing
    With delightful breakfast coming?
      Yet they whisper under the wing:
    "So we may wear whatever we like,
      Anything, everything!"



    AN OCTOBER GARDEN.


    In my Autumn garden I was fain
      To mourn among my scattered roses;
      Alas for that last rosebud which uncloses
    To Autumn's languid sun and rain
    When all the world is on the wane!
      Which has not felt the sweet constraint of June,
      Nor heard the nightingale in tune.

    Broad-faced asters by my garden walk,
      You are but coarse compared with roses:
      More choice, more dear that rosebud which uncloses
    Faint-scented, pinched, upon its stalk,
    That least and last which cold winds balk;
      A rose it is though least and last of all,
      A rose to me though at the fall.



    "SUMMER IS ENDED."


    To think that this meaningless thing was ever a rose
            Scentless, colorless, _this!_
      Will it ever be thus (who knows?)
              Thus with our bliss,
        If we wait till the close?

    Though we care not to wait for the end, there comes the end
            Sooner, later, at last,
      Which nothing can mar, nothing mend:
              An end locked fast,
        Bent we cannot re-bend.



    PASSING AND GLASSING.


        All things that pass
        Are woman's looking-glass;
    They show her how her bloom must fade,
    And she herself be laid
    With withered roses in the shade;
      With withered roses and the fallen peach,
      Unlovely, out of reach
        Of summer joy that was.

        All things that pass
        Are woman's tiring-glass;
    The faded lavender is sweet,
    Sweet the dead violet
    Culled and laid by and cared for yet;
      The dried-up violets and dried lavender
      Still sweet, may comfort her,
        Nor need she cry Alas!

        All things that pass
        Are wisdom's looking-glass;
    Being full of hope and fear, and still
    Brimful of good or ill,
    According to our work and will;
      For there is nothing new beneath the sun;
      Our doings have been done,
        And that which shall be was.



    "I WILL ARISE."


    Weary and weak,--accept my weariness;
      Weary and weak and downcast in my soul,
    With hope growing less and less,
      And with the goal
    Distant and dim,--accept my sore distress.
    I thought to reach the goal so long ago,
      At outset of the race I dreamed of rest,
    Not knowing what now I know
      Of breathless haste,
      Of long-drawn straining effort across the waste.

    One only thing I knew, Thy love of me;
      One only thing I know, Thy sacred same
    Love of me full and free,
      A craving flame
    Of selfless love of me which burns in Thee.
    How can I think of thee, and yet grow chill;
      Of Thee, and yet grow cold and nigh to death?
    Re-energize my will,
      Rebuild my faith;
      I will arise and run, Thou giving me breath.

    I will arise, repenting and in pain;
      I will arise, and smite upon my breast
    And turn to Thee again;
      Thou choosest best,
    Lead me along the road Thou makest plain.
    Lead me a little way, and carry me
      A little way, and listen to my sighs,
    And store my tears with Thee,
      And deign replies
      To feeble prayers;--O Lord, I will arise.



    A PRODIGAL SON.


    Does that lamp still burn in my Father's house,
      Which he kindled the night I went away?
    I turned once beneath the cedar boughs,
      And marked it gleam with a golden ray;
      Did he think to light me home some day?

    Hungry here with the crunching swine,
      Hungry harvest have I to reap;
    In a dream I count my Father's kine,
      I hear the tinkling bells of his sheep,
      I watch his lambs that browse and leap.

    There is plenty of bread at home,
      His servants have bread enough and to spare;
    The purple wine-fat froths with foam,
      Oil and spices make sweet the air,
      While I perish hungry and bare.

    Rich and blessed those servants, rather
      Than I who see not my Father's face!
    I will arise and go to my Father:--
      "Fallen from sonship, beggared of grace,
      Grant me, Father, a servant's place."



    SOEUR LOUISE DE LA MISÉRICORDE.

    (1674.)


    I have desired, and I have been desired;
      But now the days are over of desire,
      Now dust and dying embers mock my fire;
    Where is the hire for which my life was hired?
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire!

    Longing and love, pangs of a perished pleasure,
      Longing and love, a disenkindled fire,
      And memory a bottomless gulf of mire,
    And love a fount of tears outrunning measure;
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire!

    Now from my heart, love's deathbed, trickles, trickles,
      Drop by drop slowly, drop by drop of fire,
      The dross of life, of love, of spent desire;
    Alas, my rose of life gone all to prickles,--
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire!

    Oh vanity of vanities, desire;
      Stunting my hope which might have strained up higher,
      Turning my garden plot to barren mire;
    Oh death-struck love, oh disenkindled fire,
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire!



    AN "IMMURATA" SISTER.


    Life flows down to death; we cannot bind
      That current that it should not flee:
    Life flows down to death, as rivers find
      The inevitable sea.

    Men work and think, but women feel;
      And so (for I'm a woman, I)
      And so I should be glad to die
    And cease from impotence of zeal,
    And cease from hope, and cease from dread,
      And cease from yearnings without gain,
      And cease from all this world of pain,
    And be at peace among the dead.

    Hearts that die, by death renew their youth,
      Lightened of this life that doubts and dies;
    Silent and contented, while the Truth
      Unveiled makes them wise.

    Why should I seek and never find
      That something which I have not had?
      Fair and unutterably sad
    The world hath sought time out of mind;
    The world hath sought and I have sought,--
      Ah, empty world and empty I!
      For we have spent our strength for nought,
    And soon it will be time to die.

    Sparks fly upward toward their fount of fire,
      Kindling, flashing, hovering:--
    Kindle, flash, my soul; mount higher and higher,
      Thou whole burnt-offering!



    "IF THOU SAYEST, BEHOLD, WE KNEW IT NOT."
              --Proverbs xxiv. 11, 12.

    1.

    I have done I know not what,--what have I done?
      My brother's blood, my brother's soul, doth cry:
      And I find no defence, find no reply,
    No courage more to run this race I run
    Not knowing what I have done, have left undone;
      Ah me, these awful unknown hours that fly
      Fruitless it may be, fleeting fruitless by
    Rank with death-savor underneath the sun.
    For what avails it that I did not know
      The deed I did? what profits me the plea
    That had I known I had not wronged him so?
        Lord Jesus Christ, my God, him pity Thou;
      Lord, if it may be, pity also me:
        In judgment pity, and in death, and now.


    2.

    Thou Who hast borne all burdens, bear our load,
      Bear Thou our load whatever load it be;
      Our guilt, our shame, our helpless misery,
    Bear Thou Who only canst, O God my God.
      Seek us and find us, for we cannot Thee
    Or seek or find or hold or cleave unto:
    We cannot do or undo; Lord, undo
      Our self-undoing, for Thine is the key
    Of all we are not though we might have been.
      Dear Lord, if ever mercy moved Thy mind,
        If so be love of us can move Thee yet,
    If still the nail-prints in Thy Hands are seen,
        Remember us,--yea, how shouldst Thou forget?
      Remember us for good, and seek, and find.


    3.

    Each soul I might have succored, may have slain,
      All souls shall face me at the last Appeal,
      That great last moment poised for woe or weal,
    That final moment for man's bliss or bane.
    Vanity of vanities, yea all is vain
      Which then will not avail or help or heal:
      Disfeatured faces, worn-out knees that kneel,
    Will more avail than strength or beauty then.
    Lord, by Thy Passion,--when Thy Face was marred
      In sight of earth and hell tumultuous,
        And Thy heart failed in Thee like melting wax,
    And Thy Blood dropped more precious than the nard,--
        Lord, for Thy sake, not ours, supply our lacks,
      For Thine own sake, not ours, Christ, pity us.



    THE THREAD OF LIFE.

    1.

    The irresponsive silence of the land,
      The irresponsive sounding of the sea,
      Speak both one message of one sense to me:--
    Aloof, aloof, we stand aloof, so stand
    Thou too aloof bound with the flawless band
      Of inner solitude; we bind not thee;
      But who from thy self-chain shall set thee free?
    What heart shall touch thy heart? what hand thy hand?--
    And I am sometimes proud and sometimes meek,
      And sometimes I remember days of old
    When fellowship seemed not so far to seek
      And all the world and I seemed much less cold,
      And at the rainbow's foot lay surely gold,
    And hope felt strong and life itself not weak.


    2.

    Thus am I mine own prison. Everything
      Around me free and sunny and at ease:
      Or if in shadow, in a shade of trees
    Which the sun kisses, where the gay birds sing
    And where all winds make various murmuring;
      Where bees are found, with honey for the bees;
      Where sounds are music, and where silences
    Are music of an unlike fashioning.
    Then gaze I at the merrymaking crew,
      And smile a moment and a moment sigh
    Thinking: Why can I not rejoice with you?
      But soon I put the foolish fancy by:
    I am not what I have nor what I do;
      But what I was I am, I am even I.


    3.

    Therefore myself is that one only thing
      I hold to use or waste, to keep or give;
      My sole possession every day I live,
    And still mine own despite Time's winnowing.
    Ever mine own, while moons and seasons bring
      From crudeness ripeness mellow and sanative;
      Ever mine own, till Death shall ply his sieve;
    And still mine own, when saints break grave and sing.
    And this myself as king unto my King
      I give, to Him Who gave Himself for me;
    Who gives Himself to me, and bids me sing
      A sweet new song of His redeemed set free;
    He bids me sing: O death, where is thy sting?
      And sing: O grave, where is thy victory?



    AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.

        ..."Una selva oscura."--Dante.


    Awake or sleeping (for I know not which)
      I was or was not mazed within a wood
      Where every mother-bird brought up her brood
        Safe in some leafy niche
    Of oak or ash, of cypress or of beech,

    Of silvery aspen trembling delicately,
      Of plane or warmer-tinted sycamore,
      Of elm that dies in secret from the core,
        Of ivy weak and free,
    Of pines, of all green lofty things that be.

    Such birds they seemed as challenged each desire;
      Like spots of azure heaven upon the wing,
      Like downy emeralds that alight and sing,
        Like actual coals on fire,
      Like anything they seemed, and everything.

    Such mirth they made, such warblings and such chat
      With tongue of music in a well-tuned beak,
      They seemed to speak more wisdom than we speak,
        To make our music flat
      And all our subtlest reasonings wild or weak.

    Their meat was nought but flowers like butterflies,
      With berries coral-colored or like gold;
      Their drink was only dew, which blossoms hold
        Deep where the honey lies;
    Their wings and tails were lit by sparkling eyes.

    The shade wherein they revelled was a shade
      That danced and twinkled to the unseen sun;
      Branches and leaves cast shadows one by one,
        And all their shadows swayed
    In breaths of air that rustled and that played.

    A sound of waters neither rose nor sank,
      And spread a sense of freshness through the air;
      It seemed not here or there, but everywhere,
        As if the whole earth drank,
    Root fathom deep and strawberry on its bank.

    But I who saw such things as I have said,
      Was overdone with utter weariness;
      And walked in care, as one whom fears oppress
        Because above his head
    Death hangs, or damage, or the dearth of bread.

    Each sore defeat of my defeated life
      Faced and outfaced me in that bitter hour;
      And turned to yearning palsy all my power,
        And all my peace to strife,
    Self stabbing self with keen lack-pity knife.

    Sweetness of beauty moved me to despair,
      Stung me to anger by its mere content,
      Made me all lonely on that way I went,
        Piled care upon my care,
    Brimmed full my cup, and stripped me empty and bare:

    For all that was but showed what all was not,
      But gave clear proof of what might never be;
      Making more destitute my poverty,
        And yet more blank my lot,
      And me much sadder by its jubilee.

    Therefore I sat me down: for wherefore walk?
      And closed mine eyes: for wherefore see or hear?
      Alas, I had no shutter to mine ear,
        And could not shun the talk
      Of all rejoicing creatures far or near.

    Without my will I hearkened and I heard
      (Asleep or waking, for I know not which),
      Till note by note the music changed its pitch;
        Bird ceased to answer bird,
    And every wind sighed softly if it stirred.

    The drip of widening waters seemed to weep,
      All fountains sobbed and gurgled as they sprang,
    Somewhere a cataract cried out in its leap
        Sheer down a headlong steep;
      High over all cloud-thunders gave a clang.

    Such universal sound of lamentation
      I heard and felt, fain not to feel or hear;
      Nought else there seemed but anguish far and near;
        Nought else but all creation
      Moaning and groaning wrung by pain or fear,

    Shuddering in the misery of its doom:
      My heart then rose a rebel against light,
      Scouring all earth and heaven and depth and height,
        Ingathering wrath and gloom,
      Ingathering wrath to wrath and night to night.

    Ah me, the bitterness of such revolt,
      All impotent, all hateful, and all hate,
    That kicks and breaks itself against the bolt
        Of an imprisoning fate,
      And vainly shakes, and cannot shake the gate.

    Agony to agony, deep called to deep,
      Out of the deep I called of my desire;
      My strength was weakness and my heart was fire;
        Mine eyes that would not weep
    Or sleep, scaled height and depth, and could not sleep;

    The eyes, I mean, of my rebellious soul,
      For still my bodily eyes were closed and dark:
      A random thing I seemed without a mark,
        Racing without a goal,
      Adrift upon life's sea without an ark.

    More leaden than the actual self of lead
      Outer and inner darkness weighed on me.
      The tide of anger ebbed. Then fierce and free
        Surged full above my head
      The moaning tide of helpless misery.

    Why should I breathe, whose breath was but a sigh?
      Why should I live, who drew such painful breath?
    Oh weary work, the unanswerable why!--
        Yet I, why should I die,
      Who had no hope in life, no hope in death?

    Grasses and mosses and the fallen leaf
      Make peaceful bed for an indefinite term;
      But underneath the grass there gnaws a worm--
        Haply, there gnaws a grief--
    Both, haply always; not, as now, so brief.

    The pleasure I remember, it is past;
      The pain I feel is passing, passing by;
      Thus all the world is passing, and thus I:
        All things that cannot last
      Have grown familiar, and are born to die.

    And being familiar, have so long been borne
      That habit trains us not to break but bend:
    Mourning grows natural to us who mourn
        In foresight of an end,
      But that which ends not who shall brave or mend?

    Surely the ripe fruits tremble on their bough,
      They cling and linger trembling till they drop:
    I, trembling, cling to dying life; for how
        Face the perpetual Now?
      Birthless and deathless, void of start or stop,

    Void of repentance, void of hope and fear,
      Of possibility, alternative,
      Of all that ever made us bear to live
        From night to morning here,
      Of promise even which has no gift to give.

    The wood, and every creature of the wood,
      Seemed mourning with me in an undertone;
      Soft scattered chirpings and a windy moan,
        Trees rustling where they stood
    And shivered, showed compassion for my mood.

    Rage to despair; and now despair had turned
      Back to self-pity and mere weariness,
    With yearnings like a smouldering fire that burned,
        And might grow more or less,
      And might die out or wax to white excess.

    Without, within me, music seemed to be;
      Something not music, yet most musical,
    Silence and sound in heavenly harmony;
        At length a pattering fall
    Of feet, a bell, and bleatings, broke through all.

    Then I looked up. The wood lay in a glow
      From golden sunset and from ruddy sky;
      The sun had stooped to earth though once so high;
        Had stooped to earth, in slow
    Warm dying loveliness brought near and low.

    Each water-drop made answer to the light,
      Lit up a spark and showed the sun his face;
      Soft purple shadows paved the grassy space
        And crept from height to height,
      From height to loftier height crept up apace.

    While opposite the sun a gazing moon
      Put on his glory for her coronet,
    Kindling her luminous coldness to its noon,
        As his great splendor set;
      One only star made up her train as yet.

    Each twig was tipped with gold, each leaf was edged
      And veined with gold from the gold-flooded west;
    Each mother-bird, and mate-bird, and unfledged
        Nestling, and curious nest,
      Displayed a gilded moss or beak or breast.

    And filing peacefully between the trees,
      Having the moon behind them, and the sun
    Full in their meek mild faces, walked at ease
        A homeward flock, at peace
      With one another and with every one.

    A patriarchal ram with tinkling bell
      Led all his kin; sometimes one browsing sheep
      Hung back a moment, or one lamb would leap
        And frolic in a dell;
    Yet still they kept together, journeying well,

    And bleating, one or other, many or few,
      Journeying together toward the sunlit west;
      Mild face by face, and woolly breast by breast,
        Patient, sun-brightened too,
      Still journeying toward the sunset and their rest.



    "ALL THY WORKS PRAISE THEE, O LORD."

    A PROCESSIONAL OF CREATION.


      All.

    I, All-Creation, sing my song of praise
    To God Who made me and vouchsafes my days,
    And sends me forth by multitudinous ways.

      Seraph.

    I, like my Brethren, burn eternally
    With love of Him Who is Love, and loveth me;
    The Holy, Holy, Holy Unity.


      Cherub.

    I, with my Brethren, gaze eternally
    On Him Who is Wisdom, and Who knoweth me;
    The Holy, Holy, Holy Trinity.


      All Angels.

    We rule, we serve, we work, we store His treasure,
    Whose vessels are we, brimmed with strength and pleasure;
    Our joys fulfil, yea, overfill our measure.


      Heavens.

    We float before the Presence Infinite,
    We cluster round the Throne in our delight,
    Revolving and rejoicing in God's sight.


      Firmament.

    I, blue and beautiful, and framed of air,
    At sunrise and at sunset grow most fair;
    His glory by my glories I declare.


      Powers.

    We Powers are powers because He makes us strong;
    Wherefore we roll all rolling orbs along,
    We move all moving things, and sing our song.


      Sun.

    I blaze to Him in mine engarlanding
    Of rays, I flame His whole burnt-offering,
    While as a bridegroom I rejoice and sing.


      Moon.

    I follow, and am fair, and do His Will;
    Through all my changes I am faithful still,
    Full-orbed or strait, His mandate to fulfil.


      Stars.

    We Star-hosts numerous, innumerous,
    Throng space with energy untumultuous,
    And work His Will Whose eye beholdeth us.


      Galaxies and Nebulæ.

    No thing is far or near; and therefore we
    Float neither far nor near; but where we be
    Weave dances round the Throne perpetually.


      Comets and Meteors.

    Our lights dart here and there, whirl to and fro,
    We flash and vanish, we die down and glow;
    All doing His Will Who bids us do it so.


      Showers.

    We give ourselves; and be we great or small,
    Thus are we made like Him Who giveth all,
    Like Him Whose gracious pleasure bids us fall.


      Dews.

    We give ourselves in silent secret ways,
    Spending and spent in silence full of grace;
    And thus are made like God, and show His praise.


      Winds.

    We sift the air and winnow all the earth;
    And God Who poised our weights and weighs our worth
    Accepts the worship of our solemn mirth.


      Fire.

    My power and strength are His Who fashioned me,
    Ordained me image of His Jealousy,
    Forged me His weapon fierce exceedingly.


      Heat.

    I glow unto His glory, and do good:
    I glow, and bring to life both bud and brood;
    I glow, and ripen harvest-crops for food.


      Winter and Summer.

    Our wealth and joys and beauties celebrate
    His wealth of beauty Who sustains our state,
    Before Whose changelessness we alternate.


      Spring and Autumn.

    I hope,--
              And I remember,--

                                We give place
    Either to other with contented grace,
    Acceptable and lovely all our days.


      Frost.

    I make the unstable stable, binding fast
    The world of waters prone to ripple past:
    Thus praise I God, Whose mercies I forecast.


      Cold.

    I rouse and goad the slothful, apt to nod,
    I stir and urge the laggards with my rod:
    My praise is not of men, yet I praise God.


      Snow.

    My whiteness shadoweth Him Who is most fair,
    All spotless: yea, my whiteness which I wear
    Exalts His Purity beyond compare.


      Vapors.

    We darken sun and moon, and blot the day,
    The good Will of our Maker to obey:
    Till to the glory of God we pass away.


      Night.

    Moon and all stars I don for diadem
    To make me fair: I cast myself and them
    Before His feet, Who knows us gem from gem.


      Day.

    I shout before Him in my plenitude
    Of light and warmth, of hope and wealth and food;
    Ascribing all good to the Only Good.


      Light and Darkness.

    I am God's dwelling-place,--
                                  And also I
    Make His pavilion,--
                          Lo, we bide and fly
    Exulting in the Will of God Most High.


      Lightning and Thunder.

    We indivisible flash forth His Fame,
    We thunder forth the glory of His Name,
    In harmony of resonance and flame.


      Clouds.

    Sweet is our store, exhaled from sea or river:
    We wear a rainbow, praising God the Giver
    Because His mercy is for ever and ever.


      Earth.

    I rest in Him rejoicing: resting so
    And so rejoicing, in that I am low;
    Yet known of Him, and following on to know.


      Mountains.

    Our heights which laud Him, sink abased before
    Him higher than the highest evermore:
    God higher than the highest we adore.


      Hills.

    We green-tops praise Him, and we fruitful heads,
    Whereon the sunshine and the dew He sheds:
    We green-tops praise Him, rising from out beds.


      Green Things.

    We all green things, we blossoms bright or dim,
    Trees, bushes, brushwood, corn and grasses slim,
    We lift our many-favored lauds to Him.


      Rose,--Lily,--Violet.

    I praise Him on my thorn which I adorn,--
    And I, amid my world of thistle and thorn,--
    And I, within my veil where I am born.


      Apple,--Citron,--Pomegranate.

    We, Apple-blossom, Citron, Pomegranate,
    We, clothed of God without our toil and fret,
    We offer fatness where His Throne is set.


      Vine,--Cedar,--Palm.

    I proffer Him my sweetness, who am sweet,--
    I bow my strength in fragrance at His feet,--
    I wave myself before His Judgment Seat.


      Medicinal Herbs.

    I bring refreshment,--
                          I bring ease and calm,--
    I lavish strength and healing,--
                                    I am balm,--
    We work His pitiful Will and chant our psalm.


      A Spring.

    Clear my pure fountain, clear and pure my rill,
    My fountain and mine outflow deep and still,
    I set His semblance forth and do His Will.


      Sea.

    To-day I praise God with a sparkling face,
    My thousand thousand waves all uttering praise:
    To-morrow I commit me to His Grace.


      Floods.

    We spring and swell meandering to and fro,
    From height to depth, from depth to depth we flow,
    We fertilize the world, and praise Him so.


      Whales and Sea Mammals.

    We Whales and Monsters gambol in His sight
    Rejoicing every day and every night,
    Safe in the tender keeping of His Might.


      Fishes.

    Our fashions and our colors and our speeds
    Set forth His praise Who framed us and Who feeds,
    Who knows our number and regards our needs.


      Birds.

    Winged Angels of this visible world, we fly
    To sing God's praises in the lofty sky;
    We scale the height to praise our Lord most High.


      Eagle and Dove.

    I the sun-gazing Eagle,--
                              I the Dove,
    With plumes of softness and a note of love,--
    We praise by divers gifts One God above.


      Beasts and Cattle.

    We forest Beasts,--
                        We Beasts of hill or cave,--
    We border-loving Creatures of the wave,--
    We praise our King with voices deep and grave.


      Small Animals.

    God forms us weak and small, but pours out all
    We need, and notes us while we stand or fall:
    Wherefore we praise Him, weak and safe and small.


      Lamb.

    I praise my loving Lord, Who maketh me
    His type by harmless sweet simplicity:
    Yet He the Lamb of lambs incomparably.


      Lion.

    I praise the Lion of the Royal Race,
    Strongest in fight and swiftest in the chase:
    With all my might I leap and lavish praise.


      All Men.

    All creatures sing around us, and we sing:
    We bring our own selves as our offering,
    Our very selves we render to our King.


      Israel.

    Flock of our Shepherd's pasture and His fold,
    Purchased and well-beloved from days of old,
    We tell His praise which still remains untold.


      Priests.

    We free-will Shepherds tend His sheep, and feed;
    We follow Him while caring for their need;
    We follow praising Him, and them we lead.


      Servants of God.

    We love God, for He loves us; we are free
    In serving Him, who serve Him willingly:
    As kings we reign, and praise His Majesty.


      Holy and Humble Persons.

    All humble souls he calls and sanctifies;
    All holy souls He calls to make them wise;
    Accepting all, His free-will sacrifice.


      Babes.

    He maketh me,--
                    And me,--
                              And me,--
                                      To be
    His blessed little ones around His knee,
    Who praise Him by mere love confidingly.


      Women.

    God makes our service love, and makes our wage
    Love: so we wend on patient pilgrimage,
    Extolling Him by love from age to age.


      Men.

    God gives us power to rule: He gives us power
    To rule ourselves, and prune the exuberant flower
    Of youth, and worship Him hour after hour.


      Spirits and Souls--

    Lo, in the hidden world we chant our chant
    To Him Who fills us that we nothing want,
    To Him Whose bounty leaves our craving scant.


      of Babes--

    With milky mouths we praise God, from the breast
    Called home betimes to rest the perfect rest,
    By love and joy fufilling His behest.


      of Women--

    We praise His Will which made us what He would,
    His Will which fashioned us and called us good,
    His Will our plenary beatitude.

      of Men.

    We praise His Will Who bore with us so long,
    Who out of weakness wrought us swift and strong,
    Champions of right and putters-down of wrong.


      All.

    Let everything that hath or hath not breath,
    Let days and endless days, let life and death,
    Praise God, praise God, praise God, His creature saith.



    LATER LIFE: A DOUBLE SONNET OF SONNETS.


    1.

    Before the mountains were brought forth, before
      Earth and the world were made, then God was God:
    And God will still be God, when flames shall roar
      Round earth and heaven dissolving at His nod:
      And this God is our God, even while His rod
    Of righteous wrath falls on us smiting sore:
    And this God is our God for evermore
      Through life, through death, while clod returns to clod.
    For though He slay us we will trust in Him;
      We will flock home to Him by divers ways:
      Yea, though He slay us we will vaunt His praise,
    Serving and loving with the Cherubim,
    Watching and loving with the Seraphim,
      Our very selves His praise through endless days.


    2.

    Rend hearts and rend not garments for our sins;
      Gird sackcloth not on body but on soul;
      Grovel in dust with faces toward the goal
    Nor won, nor neared: he only laughs who wins.
    Not neared the goal, the race too late begins;
      Or left undone, we have yet to do the whole;
      The sun is hurrying west and toward the pole
    Where darkness waits for earth with all her kins.
    Let us to-day, while it is called to-day,
      Set out, if utmost speed may yet avail--
      The shadows lengthen and the light grows pale:
        For who through darkness and the shadow of death,
    Darkness that may be felt, shall find a way,
        Blind-eyed, deaf-eared, and choked with failing breath?


    3.

    Thou Who didst make and knowest whereof we are made,
      Oh bear in mind our dust and nothingness,
      Our wordless tearless dumbness of distress:
    Bear Thou in mind the burden Thou hast laid
    Upon us, and our feebleness unstayed
      Except Thou stay us: for the long long race
      Which stretches far and far before our face
    Thou knowest,--remember Thou whereof we are made.
    If making makes us Thine, then Thine we are;
      And if redemption, we are twice Thine own:
    If once Thou didst come down from heaven afar
      To seek us and to find us, how not save?
    Comfort us, save us, leave us not alone,
      Thou Who didst die our death and fill our grave.


    4.

    So tired am I, so weary of to-day,
      So unrefreshed from foregone weariness,
      So overburdened by foreseen distress,
    So lagging and so stumbling on my way,
    I scarce can rouse myself to watch or pray,
      To hope, or aim, or toil for more or less,--
      Ah, always less and less, even while I press
    Forward and toil and aim as best I may.
    Half-starved of soul and heartsick utterly,
      Yet lift I up my heart and soul and eyes
      (Which fail in looking upward) toward the prize:
    Me, Lord, Thou seest though I see not Thee;
      Me now, as once the Thief in Paradise,
    Even me, O Lord my Lord, remember me.


    5.

    Lord, Thou Thyself art Love and only Thou;
      Yet I who am not love would fain love Thee;
      But Thou alone being Love canst furnish me
    With that same love my heart is craving now.
    Allow my plea! for if Thou disallow,
      No second fountain can I find but Thee;
      No second hope or help is left to me,
    No second anything, but only Thou.
    O Love accept, according my request;
      O Love exhaust, fulfilling my desire:
      Uphold me with the strength that cannot tire,
    Nerve me to labor till Thou bid me rest,
      Kindle my fire from Thine unkindled fire,
    And charm the willing heart from out my breast.


    6.

    We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
      Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
      We see the things we do not yearn to see
    Around us: and what see we glancing back?
    Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
      Hopes that were never ours yet seemed to be,
      For which we steered on life's salt stormy sea
    Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
    If thus to look behind is all in vain,
      And all in vain to look to left or right,
    Why face we not our future once again,
    Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
      Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
    And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?


    7.

    To love and to remember; that is good:
      To love and to forget; that is not well:
      To lapse from love to hatred; that is hell
    And death and torment, rightly understood.
    Soul dazed by love and sorrow, cheer thy mood;
      More blest art thou than mortal tongue can tell:
      Ring not thy funeral but thy marriage bell,
    And salt with hope thy life's insipid food.
    Love is the goal, love is the way we wend,
      Love is our parallel unending line
        Whose only perfect Parallel is Christ,
    Beginning not begun, End without end:
        For He Who hath the heart of God sufficed,
      Can satisfy all hearts,--yea, thine and mine.


    8.

    We feel and see with different hearts and eyes:--
      Ah Christ, if all our hearts could meet in Thee
      How well it were for them and well for me,
    Our hearts Thy dear accepted sacrifice.
    Thou, only Life of hearts and Light of eyes,
      Our life, our light, if once we turn to Thee,
      So be it, O Lord, to them and so to me;
    Be all alike Thine own dear sacrifice.
    Thou Who by death hast ransomed us from death,
      Thyself God's sole well-pleasing Sacrifice,
        Thine only sacred Self I plead with Thee:
        Make Thou it well for them and well for me
    That Thou hast given us souls and wills and breath;
      And hearts to love Thee; and to see Thee, eyes.


    9.

    Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
      Beyond the drawings each of other's strength:
      One blazes through the brief bright summer's length
    Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
      While one unchangeable upon a throne
      Broods o'er the frozen heart of earth alone,
    Content to reign the bright particular star
      Of some who wander or of some who groan.
    They own no drawings each of other's strength,
      Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
        Nor veer along their courses each toward each:
      Yet are their orbits pitched in harmony
    Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
        Mayhap they talk together without speech.


    10.

    Tread softly! all the earth is holy ground.
      It may be, could we look with seeing eyes,
      This spot we stand on is a Paradise
    Where dead have come to life and lost been found,
    Where Faith has triumphed, Martyrdom been crowned,
      Where fools have foiled the wisdom of the wise;
      From this same spot the dust of saints may rise,
    And the King's prisoners come to light unbound.
    O earth, earth, earth, hear thou thy Maker's Word:
      "Thy dead thou shalt give up, nor hide thy slain"--
      Some who went weeping forth shall come again
        Rejoicing from the east or from the west,
    As doves fly to their windows, love's own bird
        Contented and desirous to the nest.[1]


    [Footnote 1:

    "Quali colombe dal disio chiamate
     Con l'ali aperte e ferme al dolce nido
     Volan per l'aer dal voler portate."

                             Dante.]

    11.

    Lifelong our stumbles, lifelong our regret,
      Lifelong our efforts failing and renewed,
      While lifelong is our witness, "God is good:"
    Who bore with us till now, bears with us yet,
    Who still remembers and will not forget,
      Who gives us light and warmth and daily food;
      And gracious promises half understood,
    And glories half unveiled, whereon to set
    Our heart of hearts and eyes of our desire;
      Uplifting us to longing and to love,
    Luring us upward from this world of mire,
      Urging us to press on and mount above
      Ourselves and all we have had experience of,
    Mounting to Him in love's perpetual fire.


    12.

    A dream there is wherein we are fain to scream,
      While struggling with ourselves we cannot speak:
      And much of all our waking life, as weak
    And misconceived, eludes us like the dream.
    For half life's seemings are not what they seem,
      And vain the laughs we laugh, the shrieks we shriek;
      Yea, all is vain that mars the settled meek
    Contented quiet of our daily theme.
    When I was young I deemed that sweets are sweet:
      But now I deem some searching bitters are
      Sweeter than sweets, and more refreshing far,
        And to be relished more, and more desired,
    And more to be pursued on eager feet,
        On feet untired, and still on feet though tired.


    13.

    Shame is a shadow cast by sin: yet shame
      Itself may be a glory and a grace,
      Refashioning the sin-disfashioned face;
    A nobler bruit than hollow-sounded fame,
    A new-lit lustre on a tarnished name,
      One virtue pent within an evil place,
      Strength for the fight, and swiftness for the race,
    A stinging salve, a life-requickening flame.
    A salve so searching we may scarcely live,
      A flame so fierce it seems that we must die,
        An actual cautery thrust into the heart:
        Nevertheless, men die not of such smart;
    And shame gives back what nothing else can give,
      Man to himself,--then sets him up on high.


    14.

    When Adam and when Eve left Paradise
      Did they love on and cling together still,
      Forgiving one another all that ill
    The twain had wrought on such a different wise?
    She propped upon his strength, and he in guise
      Of lover though of lord, girt to fulfil
      Their term of life and die when God should will;
    Lie down and sleep, and having slept arise.
    Boast not against us, O our enemy!
      To-day we fall, but we shall rise again;
    We grope to-day, to-morrow we shall see:
        What is to-day that we should fear to-day?
        A morrow cometh which shall sweep away
      Thee and thy realm of change and death and pain.


    15.

    Let woman fear to teach and bear to learn,
      Remembering the first woman's first mistake.
      Eve had for pupil the inquiring snake,
    Whose doubts she answered on a great concern;
    But he the tables so contrived to turn,
      It next was his to give and hers to take;
      Till man deemed poison sweet for her sweet sake,
    And fired a train by which the world must burn.
    Did Adam love his Eve from first to last?
      I think so; as we love who works us ill,
      And wounds us to the quick, yet loves us still.
    Love pardons the unpardonable past:
    Love in a dominant embrace holds fast
      His frailer self, and saves without her will.


    16.

    Our teachers teach that one and one make two:
      Later, Love rules that one and one make one:
      Abstruse the problems! neither need we shun,
    But skilfully to each should yield its due.
    The narrower total seems to suit the few,
      The wider total suits the common run;
      Each obvious in its sphere like moon or sun;
    Both provable by me, and both by you.
    Befogged and witless, in a wordy maze
      A groping stroll perhaps may do us good;
      If cloyed we are with much we have understood,
    If tired of half our dusty world and ways,
      If sick of fasting, and if sick of food;--
    And how about these long still-lengthening days?


    17.

    Something this foggy day, a something which
      Is neither of this fog nor of to-day,
      Has set me dreaming of the winds that play
    Past certain cliffs, along one certain beach,
      And turn the topmost edge of waves to spray:
      Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away,
    So out of reach while quite within my reach,
      As out of reach as India or Cathay!
    I am sick of where I am and where I am not,
      I am sick of foresight and of memory,
      I am sick of all I have and all I see,
        I am sick of self, and there is nothing new;
    Oh weary impatient patience of my lot!--
        Thus with myself: how fares it, Friends, with you?


    18.

    So late in Autumn half the world's asleep,
      And half the wakeful world looks pinched and pale;
      For dampness now, not freshness, rides the gale;
    And cold and colorless comes ashore the deep
    With tides that bluster or with tides that creep;
      Now veiled uncouthness wears an uncouth veil
      Of fog, not sultry haze; and blight and bale
    Have done their worst, and leaves rot on the heap.
    So late in Autumn one forgets the Spring,
      Forgets the Summer with its opulence,
    The callow birds that long have found a wing,
      The swallows that more lately gat them hence:
    Will anything like Spring, will anything
      Like Summer, rouse one day the slumbering sense?


    19.

    Here now is Winter. Winter, after all,
      Is not so drear as was my boding dream
      While Autumn gleamed its latest watery gleam
    On sapless leafage too inert to fall.
    Still leaves and berries clothe my garden wall
      Where ivy thrives on scantiest sunny beam;
      Still here a bud and there a blossom seem
    Hopeful, and robin still is musical.
    Leaves, flowers and fruit and one delightful song
      Remain; these days are short, but now the nights
      Intense and long, hang out their utmost lights;
    Such starry nights are long, yet not too long;
    Frost nips the weak, while strengthening still the strong
      Against that day when Spring sets all to rights.


    20.

    A hundred thousand birds salute the day:--
      One solitary bird salutes the night:
    Its mellow grieving wiles our grief away,
      And tunes our weary watches to delight;
    It seems to sing the thoughts we cannot say,
      To know and sing them, and to set them right;
    Until we feel once more that May is May,
      And hope some buds may bloom without a blight.
    This solitary bird outweighs, outvies,
      The hundred thousand merry-making birds
    Whose innocent warblings yet might make us wise
    Would we but follow when they bid us rise,
      Would we but set their notes of praise to words
    And launch our hearts up with them to the skies.


    21.

    A host of things I take on trust: I take
      The nightingales on trust, for few and far
      Between those actual summer moments are
    When I have heard what melody they make.
    So chanced it once at Como on the Lake:
      But all things, then, waxed musical; each star
      Sang on its course, each breeze sang on its car,
    All harmonies sang to senses wide-awake.
    All things in tune, myself not out of tune,
      Those nightingales were nightingales indeed:
      Yet truly an owl had satisfied my need,
    And wrought a rapture underneath that moon,
      Or simple sparrow chirping from a reed;
    For June that night glowed like a doubled June.


    22.

    The mountains in their overwhelming might
      Moved me to sadness when I saw them first,
    And afterwards they moved me to delight;
      Struck harmonies from silent chords which burst
      Out into song, a song by memory nursed;
    Forever unrenewed by touch or sight
    Sleeps the keen magic of each day or night,
      In pleasure and in wonder then immersed.
    All Switzerland behind us on the ascent,
      All Italy before us we plunged down
        St. Gothard, garden of forget-me-not:
        Yet why should such a flower choose such a spot?
    Could we forget that way which once we went
      Though not one flower had bloomed to weave its crown?


    23.

    Beyond the seas we know stretch seas unknown,
      Blue and bright-colored for our dim and green;
      Beyond the lands we see, stretch lands unseen
    With many-tinted tangle overgrown;
    And icebound seas there are like seas of stone,
      Serenely stormless as death lies serene;
      And lifeless tracks of sand, which intervene
    Betwixt the lands where living flowers are blown.
    This dead and living world befits our case
      Who live and die: we live in wearied hope,
    We die in hope not dead; we run a race
    To-day, and find no present halting-place;
      All things we see lie far within our scope,
    And still we peer beyond with craving face.


    24.

    The wise do send their hearts before them to
      Dear blesséd Heaven, despite the veil between;
      The foolish nurse their hearts within the screen
    Of this familiar world, where all we do
    Or have is old, for there is nothing new:
      Yet elder far that world we have not seen;
      God's Presence antedates what else hath been:
    Many the foolish seem, the wise seem few.
    Oh foolishest fond folly of a heart
      Divided, neither here nor there at rest!
        That hankers after Heaven, but clings to earth;
        That neither here nor there knows thorough mirth,
    Half-choosing, wholly missing, the good part:--
      Oh fool among the foolish, in thy quest.


    25.

    When we consider what this life we lead
      Is not, and is; how full of toil and pain,
      How blank of rest and of substantial gain,
    Beset by hunger earth can never feed,
    And propping half our hearts upon a reed;
      We cease to mourn lost treasures mourned in vain,
      Lost treasures we are fain and yet not fain
    To fetch back for a solace of our need.
    For who that feel this burden and this strain,
      This wide vacuity of hope and heart,
    Would bring their cherished well-beloved again:
      To bleed with them and wince beneath the smart,
    To have with stinted bliss such lavish bane,
      To hold in lieu of all so poor a part?


    26.

    This Life is full of numbness and of balk,
      Of haltingness and baffled short-coming,
      Of promise unfulfilled, of everything
    That is puffed vanity and empty talk:
    Its very bud hangs cankered on the stalk,
      Its very song-bird trails a broken wing,
      Its very Spring is not indeed like Spring,
    But sighs like Autumn round an aimless walk.
    This Life we live is dead for all its breath;
      Death's self it is, set off on pilgrimage,
      Travelling with tottering steps the first short stage:
        The second stage is one mere desert dust
        Where Death sits veiled amid creation's rust:--
    Unveil thy face, O Death who art not Death.


    27.

    I have dreamed of Death:--what will it be to die
      Not in a dream, but in the literal truth
      With all Death's adjuncts ghastly and uncouth,
    The pang that is the last and the last sigh?
    Too dulled, it may be, for a last good-bye,
      Too comfortless for any one to soothe,
      A helpless charmless spectacle of ruth
    Through long last hours, so long while yet they fly.
    So long to those who hopeless in their fear
      Watch the slow breath and look for what they dread:
    While I supine, with ears that cease to hear,
        With eyes that glaze, with heart-pulse running down,
      (Alas! no saint rejoicing on her bed),
        May miss the goal at last, may miss a crown.


    28.

    In life our absent friend is far away:
      But death may bring our friend exceeding near,
      Show him familiar faces long so dear
    And lead him back in reach of words we say.
    He only cannot utter yea or nay
      In any voice accustomed to our ear;
      He only cannot make his face appear
    And turn the sun back on our shadowed day.
    The dead may be around us, dear and dead;
      The unforgotten dearest dead may be
        Watching us, with unslumbering eyes and heart,
    Brimful of words which cannot yet be said,
        Brimful of knowledge they may not impart,
      Brimful of love for you and love for me.



    "FOR THINE OWN SAKE, O MY GOD."


    Wearied of sinning, wearied of repentance,
      Wearied of self, I turn, my God, to Thee;
    To Thee, my Judge, on Whose all-righteous sentence
        Hangs mine eternity:
    I turn to Thee, I plead Thyself with Thee,--
        Be pitiful to me.

    Wearied I loathe myself, I loathe my sinning,
      My stains, my festering sores, my misery:
    Thou the Beginning, Thou ere my beginning
        Didst see and didst foresee
    Me miserable, me sinful, ruined me,--
        I plead Thyself with Thee.

    I plead Thyself with Thee Who art my Maker,
      Regard Thy handiwork that cries to Thee;
    I plead Thyself with Thee Who wast partaker
        Of mine infirmity,
    Love made Thee what Thou art, the love of me,--
        I plead Thyself with Thee.



    UNTIL THE DAY BREAK.


    When will the day bring its pleasure?
      When will the night bring its rest?
    Reaper and gleaner and thresher
      Peer toward the east and the west:--
      The Sower He knoweth, and He knoweth best.

    Meteors flash forth and expire,
      Northern lights kindle and pale;
    These are the days of desire,
      Of eyes looking upward that fail;
      Vanishing days as a finishing tale.

    Bows down the crop in its glory
      Tenfold, fifty-fold, hundred-fold;
    The millet is ripened and hoary,
      The wheat ears are ripened to gold:--
      Why keep us waiting in dimness and cold?

    The Lord of the harvest, He knoweth
      Who knoweth the first and the last:
    The Sower Who patiently soweth,
      He scanneth the present and past:
      He saith, "What thou hast, what remaineth, hold fast."

    Yet, Lord, o'er Thy toil-wearied weepers
      The storm-clouds hang muttering and frown:
    On threshers and gleaners and reapers,
      O Lord of the harvest, look down;
      Oh for the harvest, the shout, and the crown!

    "Not so," saith the Lord of the reapers,
      The Lord of the first and the last:
    "O My toilers, My weary, My weepers,
      What ye have, what remaineth, hold fast.
      Hide in My heart till the vengeance be past."



    "OF HIM THAT WAS READY TO PERISH."


    Lord, I am waiting, weeping, watching for Thee:
      My youth and hope lie by me buried and dead,
      My wandering love hath not where to lay its head
        Except Thou say "Come to Me."

    My noon is ended, abolished from life and light,
      My noon is ended, ended and done away,
      My sun went down in the hours that still were day,
        And my lingering day is night.

    How long, O Lord, how long in my desperate pain
      Shall I weep and watch, shall I weep and long for Thee?
      Is Thy grace ended, Thy love cut off from me?
        How long shall I long in vain?

    O God Who before the beginning hast seen the end,
      Who hast made me flesh and blood, not frost and not fire,
      Who hast filled me full of needs and love and desire
        And a heart that craves a friend,

    Who hast said "Come to Me and I will give thee rest,"
      Who hast said "Take on thee My yoke and learn of Me,"
      Who calledst a little child to come to Thee
        And pillowedst John on Thy breast;

    Who spak'st to women that followed Thee sorrowing,
      Bidding them weep for themselves and weep for their own;
      Who didst welcome the outlaw adoring Thee all alone,
        And plight Thy word as a King,--

    By Thy love of these and of all that ever shall be,
      By Thy love of these and of all the born and unborn,
      Turn Thy gracious eyes on me and think no scorn
        Of me, not even of me.

    Beside Thy Cross I hang on my cross in shame,
      My wounds, weakness, extremity cry to Thee:
      Bid me also to Paradise, also me
        For the glory of Thy Name.



    "BEHOLD THE MAN!"


    Shall Christ hang on the Cross, and we not look?
      Heaven, earth, and hell stood gazing at the first,
      While Christ for long-cursed man was counted cursed;
    Christ, God and Man, Whom God the Father strook
    And shamed and sifted and one while forsook:--
      Cry shame upon our bodies we have nursed
      In sweets, our souls in pride, our spirits immersed
    In wilfulness, our steps run all acrook.
    Cry shame upon us! for He bore our shame
      In agony, and we look on at ease
    With neither hearts on flame nor cheeks on flame:
      What hast thou, what have I, to do with peace?
    Not to send peace but send a sword He came,
      And fire and fasts and tearful night-watches.



    THE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS.


    Is this the Face that thrills with awe
      Seraphs who veil their face above?
    Is this the Face without a flaw,
      The Face that is the Face of Love?
    Yea, this defaced, a lifeless clod,
      Hath all creation's love sufficed,
    Hath satisfied the love of God,
      This Face the Face of Jesus Christ.



    "IT IS FINISHED."


    Dear Lord, let me recount to Thee
    Some of the great things thou hast done
        For me, even me
        Thy little one.

    It was not I that cared for Thee,--
    But Thou didst set Thy heart upon
        Me, even me
        Thy little one.

    And therefore was it sweet to Thee
    To leave Thy Majesty and Throne,
        And grow like me
        A Little One,

    A swaddled Baby on the knee
    Of a dear Mother of Thine own,
        Quite weak like me
        Thy little one.

    Thou didst assume my misery,
    And reap the harvest I had sown,
        Comforting me
        Thy little one.

    Jerusalem and Galilee,--
    Thy love embraced not those alone,
        But also me
        Thy little one.

    Thy unblemished Body on the Tree
    Was bared and broken to atone
        For me, for me
        Thy little one.

    Thou lovedst me upon the Tree,--
    Still me, hid by the ponderous stone,--
        Me always,--me
        Thy little one.

    And love of me arose with Thee
    When death and hell lay overthrown:
        Thou lovedst me
        Thy little one.

    And love of me went up with Thee
    To sit upon Thy Father's Throne:
        Thou lovest me
        Thy little one.

    Lord, as Thou me, so would I Thee
    Love in pure love's communion,
        For Thou lov'st me
        Thy little one:

    Which love of me brings back with Thee
    To Judgment when the Trump is blown,
        Still loving me
        Thy little one.



    AN EASTER CAROL.


            Spring bursts to-day,
    For Christ is risen and all the earth's at play.

            Flash forth, thou Sun,
    The rain is over and gone, its work is done.

            Winter is past,
    Sweet Spring is come at last, is come at last.

            Bud, Fig and Vine,
    Bud, Olive, fat with fruit and oil and wine.

            Break forth this morn
    In roses, thou but yesterday a Thorn.

            Uplift thy head,
    O pure white Lily through the Winter dead.

            Beside your dams
    Leap and rejoice, you merry-making Lambs.

            All Herds and Flocks
    Rejoice, all Beasts of thickets and of rocks.

            Sing, Creatures, sing,
    Angels and Men and Birds and everything.

            All notes of Doves
    Fill all our world: this is the time of loves.



    "BEHOLD A SHAKING."


    1.

    Man rising to the doom that shall not err,--
      Which hath most dread: the arouse of all or each;
      All kindreds of all nations of all speech,
    Or one by one of _him_ and _him_ and _her_?
    While dust reanimate begins to stir
      Here, there, beyond, beyond, reach beyond reach;
      While every wave refashions on the beach
    Alive or dead-in-life some seafarer.
    Now meeting doth not join or parting part;
      True meeting and true parting wait till then,
        When whoso meet are joined for evermore,
    Face answering face and heart at rest in heart:--
        God bring us all rejoicing to the shore
      Of happy Heaven, His sheep home to the pen.


    2.

    Blessèd that flock safe penned in Paradise;
      Blessèd this flock which tramps in weary ways;
      All form one flock, God's flock; all yield Him praise
    By joy or pain, still tending toward the prize.
    Joy speaks in praises there, and sings and flies
      Where no night is, exulting all its days;
      Here, pain finds solace, for, behold, it prays;
    In both love lives the life that never dies.
    Here life is the beginning of our death,
      And death the starting-point whence life ensues;
        Surely our life is death, our death is life:
        Nor need we lay to heart our peace or strife,
    But calm in faith and patience breathe the breath
      God gave, to take again when He shall choose.



    ALL SAINTS.


    They are flocking from the East
    And the West,
    They are flocking from the North
    And the South,
    Every moment setting forth
    From realm of snake or lion,
    Swamp or sand,
    Ice or burning;
    Greatest and least,
    Palm in hand
    And praise in mouth,
    They are flocking up the path
    To their rest,
    Up the path that hath
    No returning.

    Up the steeps of Zion
    They are mounting,
    Coming, coming,
    Throngs beyond man's counting;
    With a sound
    Like innumerable bees
    Swarming, humming
    Where flowering trees
    Many-tinted,
    Many-scented,
    All alike abound
    With honey,--
    With a swell
    Like a blast upswaying unrestrainable
    From a shadowed dell
    To the hill-tops sunny,--
    With a thunder
    Like the ocean when in strength
    Breadth and length
    It sets to shore;
    More and more
    Waves on waves redoubled pour
    Leaping flashing to the shore
    (Unlike the under
    Drain of ebb that loseth ground
    For all its roar.)

    They are thronging
    From the East and West,
    From the North and South,
    Saints are thronging, loving, longing,
    To their land
    Of rest,
    Palm in hand
    And praise in mouth.



    "TAKE CARE OF HIM."


    "Thou whom I love, for whom I died,
      Lovest thou Me, My bride?"--
    Low on my knees I love Thee, Lord,
      Believed in and adored.

    "That I love thee the proof is plain:
      How dost thou love again?"--
    In prayer, in toil, in earthly loss,
      In a long-carried cross.

    "Yea, thou dost love: yet one adept
      Brings more for Me to accept."--
    I mould my will to match with Thine,
      My wishes I resign.

    "Thou givest much: then give the whole
      For solace of My soul."--
    More would I give, if I could get:
      But, Lord, what lack I yet?

    "In Me thou lovest Me: I call
      Thee to love Me in all."--
    Brim full my heart, dear Lord, that so
      My love may overflow.

    "Love Me in sinners and in saints,
      In each who needs or faints."--
    Lord, I will love Thee as I can
      In every brother man.

    "All sore, all crippled, all who ache,
      Tend all for My dear sake."--
    All for Thy sake, Lord: I will see
      In every sufferer, Thee.

    "So I at last, upon My Throne
      Of glory, Judge alone,
    So I at last will say to thee:
      Thou diddest it to Me."



    A MARTYR.

    THE VIGIL OF THE FEAST.


    Inner not outer, without gnash of teeth
      Or weeping, save quiet sobs of some who pray
      And feel the Everlasting Arms beneath,--
    Blackness of darkness this, but not for aye;
      Darkness that even in gathering fleeteth fast,
      Blackness of blackest darkness close to day.
    Lord Jesus, through Thy darkened pillar cast,
      Thy gracious eyes all-seeing cast on me
      Until this tyranny be overpast.
    Me, Lord, remember who remember Thee,
      And cleave to Thee, and see Thee without sight,
      And choose Thee still in dire extremity,
    And in this darkness worship Thee my Light,
      And Thee my Life adore in shadow of death,
      Thee loved by day, and still beloved by night.
    It is the Voice of my Beloved that saith:
      "I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, I go
      Whither that soul knows well that followeth"--

    O Lord, I follow, little as I know;
      At this eleventh hour I rise and take
      My life into my hand, and follow so,
    With tears and heart-misgivings and heart-ache;
      Thy feeblest follower, yet Thy follower
      Indomitable for Thine only sake.
    To-night I gird my will afresh, and stir
      My strength, and brace my heart to do and dare,
      Marvelling: Will to-morrow wake the whirr
    Of the great rending wheel, or from his lair
      Startle the jubilant lion in his rage,
      Or clench the headsman's hand within my hair,
    Or kindle fire to speed my pilgrimage,
      Chariot of fire and horses of sheer fire
      Whirling me home to heaven by one fierce stage?
    Thy Will I will, I Thy desire desire;
      Let not the waters close above my head,
      Uphold me that I sink not in this mire:
    For flesh and blood are frail and sore afraid;
      And young I am, unsatisfied and young,
      With memories, hopes, with cravings all unfed,
    My song half sung, its sweetest notes unsung,
      All plans cut short, all possibilities,
      Because my cord of life is soon unstrung.
    Was I a careless woman set at ease
      That this so bitter cup is brimmed for me?

      Had mine own vintage settled on the lees?
    A word, a puff of smoke, would set me free;
      A word, a puff of smoke, over and gone:...
      Howbeit, whom have I, Lord, in heaven but Thee?
    Yea, only Thee my choice is fixed upon
      In heaven or earth, eternity or time:--
      Lord, hold me fast, Lord, leave me not alone,
    Thy silly heartless dove that sees the lime
      Yet almost flutters to the tempting bough:
      Cover me, hide me, pluck me from this crime.
    A word, a puff of smoke, would save me now:...
      But who, my God, would save me in the day
      Of Thy fierce anger? only Saviour Thou.
    Preoccupy my heart, and turn away
      And cover up mine eyes from frantic fear,
      And stop mine ears lest I be driven astray:
    For one stands ever dinning in mine ear
      How my gray Father withers in the blight
      Of love for me, who cruel am and dear;
    And how my Mother through this lingering night
      Until the day, sits tearless in her woe,
      Loathing for love of me the happy light
    Which brings to pass a concourse and a show
      To glut the hungry faces merciless,
    The thousand faces swaying to and fro,
      Feasting on me unveiled in helplessness

      Alone,--yet not alone: Lord, stand by me
      As once by lonely Paul in his distress.
    As blossoms to the sun I turn to Thee;
      Thy dove turns to her window, think no scorn;
      As one dove to an ark on shoreless sea,
    To Thee I turn mine eyes, my heart forlorn;
      Put forth Thy scarred right Hand, kind Lord, take hold
      Of me Thine all-forsaken dove who mourn:
    For Thou hast loved me since the days of old,
      And I love Thee Whom loving I will love
      Through life's short fever-fits of heat and cold;
    Thy Name will I extol and sing thereof,
      Will flee for refuge to Thy Blessèd Name.
      Lord, look upon me from thy bliss above:
    Look down on me, who shrink from all the shame
      And pangs and desolation of my death,
      Wrenched piecemeal or devoured or set on flame,
    While all the world around me holds its breath
      With eyes glued on me for a gazing-stock,
      Pitiless eyes, while no man pitieth.
    The floods are risen, I stagger in their shock,
      My heart reels and is faint, I fail, I faint:
      My God, set Thou me up upon the rock,
    Thou Who didst long ago Thyself acquaint
      With death, our death; Thou Who didst long ago

      Pour forth Thy soul for sinner and for saint.
    Bear me in mind, whom no one else will know;
      Thou Whom Thy friends forsook, take Thou my part,
      Of all forsaken in mine overthrow;
    Carry me in Thy bosom, in Thy heart,
      Carry me out of darkness into light,
      To-morrow make me see Thee as Thou art.
    Lover and friend Thou hidest from my sight:--
      Alas, alas, mine earthly love, alas,
      For whom I thought to don the garments white
    And white wreath of a bride, this rugged pass
      Hath utterly divorced me from thy care;
      Yea, I am to thee as a shattered glass
    Worthless, with no more beauty lodging there,
      Abhorred, lest I involve thee in my doom:
      For sweet are sunshine and this upper air,
    And life and youth are sweet, and give us room
      For all most sweetest sweetnesses we taste:
      Dear, what hast thou in common with a tomb?
    I bow my head in silence, I make haste
      Alone, I make haste out into the dark,
      My life and youth and hope all run to waste.
    Is this my body cold and stiff and stark,
      Ashes made ashes, earth becoming earth,
      Is this a prize for man to make his mark?

    Am I, that very I who laughed in mirth
      A while ago, a little, little while,
      Yet all the while a-dying since my birth?
    Now am I tired, too tired to strive or smile;
      I sit alone, my mouth is in the dust:
      Look Thou upon me, Lord, for I am vile.
    In Thee is all my hope, is all my trust,
      On Thee I centre all my self that dies,
      And self that dies not with its mortal crust,
    But sleeps and wakes, and in the end will rise
      With hymns and hallelujahs on its lips,
      Thee loving with the love that satisfies.
    As once in Thine unutterable eclipse
      The sun and moon grew dark for sympathy,
      And earth cowered quaking underneath the drips
    Of Thy slow Blood priceless exceedingly,
      So now a little spare me, and show forth
      Some pity, O my God, some pity of me.
    If trouble comes not from the south or north,
      But meted to us by Thy tender hand,
      Let me not in Thine eyes be nothing worth:
    Behold me where in agony I stand,
      Behold me no man caring for my soul,
      And take me to Thee in the far-off land,
    Shorten the race and lift me to the goal.



    WHY?


    Lord, if I love Thee and Thou lovest me,
      Why need I any more these toilsome days;
      Why should I not run singing up Thy ways
    Straight into heaven, to rest myself with Thee?
    What need remains of death-pang yet to be,
      If all my soul is quickened in Thy praise;
      If all my heart loves Thee, what need the amaze,
    Struggle and dimness of an agony?--
    Bride whom I love, if thou too lovest Me,
      Thou needs must choose My Likeness for thy dower:
        So wilt thou toil in patience, and abide
      Hungering and thirsting for that blessed hour
    When I My Likeness shall behold in thee,
        And thou therein shalt waken satisfied.



    "LOVE IS STRONG AS DEATH."


    "I have not sought Thee, I have not found Thee,
       I have not thirsted for Thee:
     And now cold billows of death surround me,
     Buffeting billows of death astound me,--
       Wilt Thou look upon, wilt Thou see
       Thy perishing me?"

    "Yea, I have sought thee, yea, I have found thee,
       Yea, I have thirsted for thee,
     Yea, long ago with love's bands I bound thee:
     Now the Everlasting Arms surround thee,--
       Through death's darkness I look and see
       And clasp thee to Me."



    BIRCHINGTON CHURCHYARD.


    A lowly hill which overlooks a flat,
      Half sea, half country side;
      A flat-shored sea of low-voiced creeping tide
    Over a chalky, weedy mat.

    A hill of hillocks, flowery and kept green
      Round Crosses raised for hope,
      With many-tinted sunsets where the slope
    Faces the lingering western sheen.

    A lowly hope, a height that is but low,
      While Time sets solemnly,
      While the tide rises of Eternity,
    Silent and neither swift nor slow.



    ONE SEA-SIDE GRAVE.


    Unmindful of the roses,
      Unmindful of the thorn,
    A reaper tired reposes
      Among his gathered corn:
      So might I, till the morn!

    Cold as the cold Decembers,
      Past as the days that set,
    While only one remembers
      And all the rest forget,--
      But one remembers yet.



    BROTHER BRUIN.


    A dancing Bear grotesque and funny
    Earned for his master heaps of money,
    Gruff yet good-natured, fond of honey,
    And cheerful if the day was sunny.
    Past hedge and ditch, past pond and wood
    He tramped, and on some common stood;
    There, cottage children circling gaily,
    He in their midmost footed daily.
    Pandean pipes and drum and muzzle
    Were quite enough his brain to puzzle:
    But like a philosophic bear
    He let alone extraneous care
    And danced contented anywhere.

    Still, year on year, and wear and tear,
    Age even the gruffest, bluffest bear.
    A day came when he scarce could prance,
    And when his master looked askance
    On dancing Bear who would not dance.

    To looks succeeded blows; hard blows
    Battered his ears and poor old nose.
    From bluff and gruff he waxed curmudgeon;
    He danced indeed, but danced in dudgeon,
    Capered in fury fast and faster.
    Ah, could he once but hug his master
    And perish in one joint disaster!
    But deafness, blindness, weakness growing,
    Not fury's self could keep him going.
    One dark day when the snow was snowing
    His cup was brimmed to overflowing:
    He tottered, toppled on one side,
    Growled once, and shook his head, and died.
    The master kicked and struck in vain,
    The weary drudge had distanced pain
    And never now would wince again.
    The master growled; he might have howled
    Or coaxed,--that slave's last growl was growled.
    So gnawed by rancor and chagrin
    One thing remained: he sold the skin.

    What next the man did is not worth
    Your notice or my setting forth,
    But hearken what befell at last.
    His idle working days gone past,
    And not one friend and not one penny
    Stored up (if ever he had any
    Friends; but his coppers had been many),
    All doors stood shut against him but
    The workhouse door, which cannot shut.
    There he droned on,--a grim old sinner,
    Toothless, and grumbling for his dinner,
    Unpitied quite, uncared for much
    (The rate-payers not favoring such),
    Hungry and gaunt, with time to spare;
    Perhaps the hungry, gaunt old Bear
    Danced back, a haunting memory.
    Indeed, I hope so, for you see
    If once the hard old heart relented,
    The hard old man may have repented.



    "A HELPMEET FOR HIM."


    Woman was made for man's delight,--
      Charm, O woman! Be not afraid!
    His shadow by day, his moon by night,
      Woman was made.

    Her strength with weakness is overlaid;
      Meek compliances veil her might;
    Him she stays, by whom she is stayed.

    World-wide champion of truth and right,
      Hope in gloom, and in danger aid,
    Tender and faithful, ruddy and white,
      Woman was made.



    A SONG OF FLIGHT.


    While we slumber and sleep,
    The sun leaps up from the deep,--
    Daylight born at the leap,--
    Rapid, dominant, free,
    Athirst to bathe in the uttermost sea.

    While we linger at play--
    If the year would stand at May!--
    Winds are up and away,
    Over land, over sea,
    To their goal, wherever their goal may be.

    It is time to arise,
    To race for the promised prize;
    The sun flies, the wind flies,
    We are strong, we are free,
    And home lies beyond the stars and the sea.



    A WINTRY SONNET.


    A robin said: The Spring will never come,
      And I shall never care to build again.
    A Rosebush said: These frosts are wearisome,
      My sap will never stir for sun or rain.
    The half Moon said: These nights are fogged and slow,
      I neither care to wax nor care to wane.
    The Ocean said: I thirst from long ago,
      Because earth's rivers cannot fill the main.
    When springtime came, red Robin built a nest,
      And trilled a lover's song in sheer delight.
      Gray hoarfrost vanished, and the Rose with might
      Clothed her in leaves and buds of crimson core.
    The dim Moon brightened. Ocean sunned his crest,
      Dimpled his blue,--yet thirsted evermore.



    RESURGAM.


    From depth to height, from height to loftier height,
      The climber sets his foot and sets his face,
      Tracks lingering sunbeams to their halting-place,
    And counts the last pulsations of the light.
    Strenuous thro' day and unsurprised by night
      He runs a race with Time, and wins the race,
      Emptied and stripped of all save only Grace,
    Will, Love,--a threefold panoply of might.
    Darkness descends for light he toiled to seek;
      He stumbles on the darkened mountain-head,
        Left breathless in the unbreathable thin air,
      Made freeman of the living and the dead,--
    He wots not he has topped the topmost peak,
        But the returning sun will find him there.



    TO-DAY'S BURDEN.


    "Arise, depart, for this is not your rest."
      Oh, burden of all burdens,--still to arise
      And still depart, nor rest in any wise!
    Rolling, still rolling thus to east from west,
    Earth journeys on her immemorial quest,
      Whom a moon chases in no different guise.
      Thus stars pursue their courses, and thus flies
    The sun, and thus all creatures manifest
    Unrest, the common heritage, the ban
      Flung broadcast on all humankind,--on all
        Who live; for living, all are bound to die.
    That which is old, we know that it is man.
        These have no rest who sit and dream and sigh,
      Nor have those rest who wrestle and who fall.



    "THERE IS A BUDDING MORROW IN MIDNIGHT."


    Wintry boughs against a wintry sky;
        Yet the sky is partly blue
            And the clouds are partly bright.
    Who can tell but sap is mounting high
            Out of sight,
    Ready to burst through?

    Winter is the mother-nurse of Spring,
        Lovely for her daughter's sake.
            Not unlovely for her own;
    For a future buds in everything
            Grown or blown
    Or about to break.



    EXULTATE DEO.


    Many a flower hath perfume for its dower,
        And many a bird a song,
    And harmless lambs milkwhite beside their dams
        Frolic along,--
    Perfume and song and whiteness offering praise
        In humble, peaceful ways.

    Man's high degree hath will and memory,
        Affection and desire;
    By loftier ways he mounts of prayer and praise,
        Fire unto fire,
    Deep unto deep responsive, height to height,
        Until he walk in white.



    A HOPE CAROL.


    A night was near, a day was near;
      Between a day and night
    I heard sweet voices calling clear,
        Calling me:
    I heard a whirr of wing on wing,
      But could not see the sight;
    I long to see my birds that sing,--
        I long to see.

    Below the stars, beyond the moon,
      Between the night and day,
    I heard a rising falling tune
        Calling me:
    I long to see the pipes and strings
      Whereon such minstrels play;
    I long to see each face that sings,--
        I long to see.

    To-day or may be not to-day,
      To-night or not to-night;
    All voices that command or pray,
        Calling me,
    Shall kindle in my soul such fire,
      And in my eyes such light,
    That I shall see that heart's desire
        I long to see.



    CHRISTMAS CAROLS.


    1.

    Whoso hears a chiming for Christmas at the nighest,
      Hears a sound like Angels chanting in their glee,
    Hears a sound like palm-boughs waving in the highest,
      Hears a sound like ripple of a crystal sea.

    Sweeter than a prayer-bell for a saint in dying,
      Sweeter than a death-bell for a saint at rest,
    Music struck in Heaven with earth's faint replying,
      "Life is good, and death is good, for Christ is Best."


    2.

    A holy, heavenly chime
    Rings fulness in of time,
    And on His Mother's breast
    Our Lord God ever-Blest
    Is laid a Babe at rest.

    Stoop, Spirits unused to stoop,
    Swoop, Angels, flying swoop,
    Adoring as you gaze,
    Uplifting hymns of praise,--
    "Grace to the Full of Grace!"

    The cave is cold and strait
    To hold the angelic state.
    More strait it is, more cold,
    To foster and infold
    Its Maker one hour old.

    Thrilled through with awestruck love,
    Meek Angels poised above,
    To see their God look down.
    "What, is there never a Crown
    For Him in swaddled gown?

    "How comes He soft and weak
    With such a tender cheek,
    With such a soft, small hand?--
    The very Hand which spann'd
    Heaven when its girth was plann'd.

    "How comes He with a voice
    Which is but baby-noise?--
    That Voice which spake with might:
    'Let there be light!' and light
    Sprang out before our sight.

    "What need hath He of flesh
    Made flawless now afresh?
    What need of human heart?--
    Heart that must bleed and smart,
    Choosing the better part.

    "But see: His gracious smile
    Dismisses us a while
    To serve Him in His kin.
    Haste we, make haste, begin
    To fetch His brethren in."

    Like stars they flash and shoot,
    The Shepherds they salute.
    "Glory to God" they sing;
    "Good news of peace we bring,
    For Christ is born a King."


    3.

    Lo! newborn Jesus,
      Soft and weak and small,
    Wrapped in baby's bands
    By His Mother's hands,
      Lord God of all.

    Lord God of Mary,
      Whom His Lips caress
    While He rocks to rest
    On her milky breast
      In helplessness.

    Lord God of shepherds
      Flocking through the cold,
    Flocking through the dark
    To the only Ark,
      The only Fold.

    Lord God of all things,
      Be they near or far,
    Be they high or low;
    Lord of storm and snow,
      Angel and star.

    Lord God of all men,--
      My Lord and my God!
    Thou who lovest me,
    Keep me close to Thee
      By staff and rod.

    Lo! newborn Jesus,
      Loving great and small,
    Love's free Sacrifice,
    Opening Arms and Eyes
      To one and all.



    A CANDLEMAS DIALOGUE.


    "Love brought Me down; and cannot love make thee
    Carol for joy to Me?
    Hear cheerful robin carol from his tree,
    Who owes not half to Me
    I won for thee."

    "Yea, Lord, I hear his carol's wordless voice;
    And well may he rejoice
    Who hath not heard of death's discordant noise.
    So might I too rejoice
    With such a voice."

    "True, thou hast compassed death; but hast not thou
    The tree of life's own bough?
    Am I not Life and Resurrection now?
    My Cross balm-bearing bough
    For such as thou?"

    "Ah me, Thy Cross!--but that seems far away;
    Thy Cradle-song to-day
    I too would raise, and worship Thee and pray:
    Not empty, Lord, to-day
    Send me away."

    "If thou wilt not go empty, spend thy store;
    And I will give thee more,
    Yea, make thee ten times richer than before.
    Give more and give yet more
    Out of thy store."

    "Because Thou givest me Thyself, I will
    Thy blessed word fulfil,
    Give with both hands, and hoard by giving still;
    Thy pleasure to fulfil,
    And work Thy Will."



    MARY MAGDALENE AND THE OTHER MARY.

    A SONG FOR ALL MARIES.


    Our Master lies asleep and is at rest;
      His Heart has ceased to bleed, His Eye to weep.
    The sun ashamed has dropt down in the west;
      Our Master lies asleep.

      Now we are they who weep, and trembling keep
    Vigil, with wrung heart in a sighing breast,
      While slow time creeps, and slow the shadows creep.

    Renew Thy youth, as eagle from the nest;
      O Master, who hast sown, arise to reap:
    No cock-crow yet, no flush on eastern crest;
      Our Master lies asleep.



    PATIENCE OF HOPE.


    The flowers that bloom in sun and shade
      And glitter in the dew,
        The flowers must fade.
    The birds that build their nest and sing
      When lovely spring is new,
        Must soon take wing.

    The sun that rises in his strength
      To wake and warm the world,
        Must set at length.
    The sea that overflows the shore
      With billows frothed and curled,
        Must ebb once more.

    All come and go, all wax and wane,
      O Lord, save only Thou
        Who dost remain
    The Same to all eternity.
      All things which fail us now
        We trust to Thee.
